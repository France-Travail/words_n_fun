If you can (and you should), save as much money as you can while at college, pay your tuition in full and student loans as soon as possible instead of spending on liabilities like gadgets.

What I can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what courses/programme you took for your education.
Engineering students require computer specs that can run BIM software. I'm not sure about the other programmes but from what I can see that most students at my place has 8GB of RAM for their laptops.

Also, here is my setup during my university years. Hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their college/university years. All the best.

My research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue.

- this kind of got glossed over but although Google play takes the same cut for purchases as Apple, you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like, so they avoid the heat there.

Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.

I bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.

I didn't do this yet as I did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so

The main implications of AI is that it is self improving, the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen
is that AI is going to overtake humans in a lot of things, including research and science. It is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change
everything about life far more than the industrial era did. For  example, 300 years from now we can have an AI program that has been improving itself for 300 years.
We lose about 1.4 million people each year from car accidents, and that is just fatalities, there are also many more injuries. So while I understand people being
skeptical about machines driving cars, as time goes on it is not even going to be close, AI is going to be able to do many, many things better than humans.
At some point, these quantum computers are going to make AI, they could program an AI to make a better AI of itself, an improved version.

You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.

This is a common misconception. While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other. Most people's phones were exploding while fast charging, which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery, and lithium-ion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that.

Edit: Normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine, and would never cause issues, but they made the battery too thin, meaning it shorted it out easier. Just wanted to clarify that.",2.0,0.0

Rus‚Äô ought not to be confused with ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù, which derives its name from the Rus‚Äô but historically is a completely different state, which almost all its existence was at war with the Rus‚Äô. 

Just like the Holy Roman Empire was actually Germany, Russia is actually Muscovy, despite their best attempts to convince everybody otherwise. 

Its name ‚ÄúRussia"" received only in 1721, when Peter I passed a decree to change Tsardom of Muscovy‚Äôs name into the ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù Empire (‚ÄúRussia‚Äù originates from Rosia, name used by the Greek Orthodox Clergy in regards to Kyivan Rus')
Under the reign of Cathrine II Muscovites where even punished for continuing to identify as Muscovites, and were forced to call themselves ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù. 

Lands that ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù claims were part of the original Rus‚Äô, but actually weren't, are Novgorod, Suzdal, and Ryazan, since in historical texts of XI-XII centuries they are mentioned as separate entities from Rus‚Äô. They can be considered parts of extended Rus‚Äô, although their culture was distinct from main Rus‚Äô.

In 1493 Moscow prince Ivan III appointed himself to be the Great Ruler of All Rus‚Äô. No other kings acknowledged that. From that point on Muscovy started to make false claims on Rus‚Äô ownership.

‚ÄúRussia‚Äù is an offshoot of Ukraine and not the other way round, despite what Soviet and ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù historians have been trying to say for years. Kiev was a developed cultured capital when Moscow was just another swamp village.




Germany used to call itself the Holy Roman Empire, that didn‚Äôt mean they became the Romans, and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of Italy and its history, but yet, that‚Äôs exactly what ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù did in regards to Rus‚Äô-Ukraine, which is a horrible injustice!",1.0,1.0

How aggressive is ABL in your testing? Please let us know. Thank you!",11.0,1.0

Wow, please compare to the C2 you had as a monitor? side by side to see that contrast difference, uniform brightness difference etc for those comparing the C2 42 and this. Love your content",4.0,2.0
1104,f-OUonH08fo,"Thanks for the review, i can't wait for your full review!

My dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this:  42 inches or so, anti-glare, normal aspect ratio not ultra wide, but 1440 @ 200mhz instead of 4k (because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k @ 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway).

If possible, i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review:

- What do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor (try playing a game in 1080/1440 and seeing what the monitor's scaling is like)
- In the settings, what HDR options are available?

Thanks!",0.0,2.0
1105,f-OUonH08fo,"Hi @SpawnPoiint, I'm looking forward to the complete review, you're the most thorough and thoughtful reviewer I've seen.

One thing I'd like to see in the review is a comparison with a matte screen, ideally a side-by-side in different conditions to illustrate the pros and cons and help us decide what coating we prefer.
Don't know if that's feasible for you. In any case thanks for the work and enjoy :)",1.0,2.0

That happened to my family. Christmas 1991 and all my brothers and sisters are there, 4 of us ranging from 10 to 18 years old. My parents had a single present for the 4 of us, the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World.

It was one of the best gifts of all our lives, because we had all wanted the SNES badly. We literally played it all that Christmas Eve night and into Christmas day. It's a great family memory that we all still hold with us, now all in our 40's and 50's with families of our own.",233.0,1.0

For ones like Tierney, Tomiyasu, and Smith Rowe who were main starters for Arsenal last season, we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by. I hope they can be patient, grab the opportunities, and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on. Compared to the last season, this is a huge improvement.

1425,RxhDx1gpoeo,"Very entertaining, one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected.  I remember my wife was given a free ticket to a Diamondbacks game, which went zero/zero so she finally left and when she came home she said ""I got bored with the game"".  The Diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left, winning the game.  

I teased her endlessly after that, suggesting she should not attend more D-backs games, and they went on to win the world series that year, my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the Yankees and Luis Gonzalez base hit that won the game.

I met Joe Montana, and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl, and I saw the ending in French, in Montreal, in '90.   During my flight from SFO to Toronto and the connecting flight to Montreal, our Air Canada pilot gave us updates on a one-sided blowout.

I also will never forget the Stanford/Cal game in 82 and ""The Play"" when Cal beat Stanford, and the band became part of the game.  Some still argue over two of the lateral passes, but the win for Cal was as it was, and I still say, that is among the craziest moments in sports history.

My own crazy moment was when I was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team, even though I was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team, the school we played had no players above the sixth grade, so I agreed.  We won the game, though I had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game.  Adrenalin had me psyched, and our QB said I threw perfect spirals.  I would intimidate the bigger players since they feared I'd plow under them and stop them from getting to the QB, and they never did, he was not sacked.

Our team went on to win the Norcal championship, undefeated, in our twelve team league, my brother playing as wide receiver, though I no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders.  I never went on to play in high school, feeling I was too small to be as good as I was in my grammar school game, where I also played on the defense, and I stuck to distance cycling and golf, both of which I enjoyed and also had many ""crazy"" moments, and I was decent at the 440 as it was then, now the 400 meters.

Even in my early 60's now, and despite a leg I broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago, I still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing.

On my channel here @Cactus521 I even have a video of me jumping off the Vegas Stratosphere tower when I was 52, though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered, I felt peace, and not fear, on the way down, choosing that vs. skydiving as my free fall bucket list item, since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane. üòÇ",8.0,2.0

I don't have time = It is not a priority
Time is a choice, it is elastic.
We have enough time, almost all of us. Make the experiences enjoyable, such as, you can read or listen to a book while commuting.

Even if we are busy we have time for what matters. (quoting her)",14.0,2.0
1815,n3kNlFMXslo,"We are so obsessed with time just like someone already said in the comments. But on the other hand we will always find time for the things that truly matter to us and that's what Laura Vanderkam says in her talk.
I used to rush myself on the bike to school and I love cycling.. but I wanted to be there as fast as possible so that I'd have more time to study. Yet every time I would rush through, I'd be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me, making me feel frustrated with the time I was wasting waiting at the red lights. All I was left with was more sweat, frustration and muscle pain. So I decided this was not going to do it. Now I cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature: the rain, the sunshine, the wind, the smells of life, everything, listening to the city or the birds. I even have time to stop if I see a cat and try to give it some snacks. I arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day. It's my favorite thing to do now. 
Making a priority list will make your life better. Especially the relationships and self categories. Taking time to just be present in the moment and live. Ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead. 
Or instead of procrastinating by scrolling through Facebook, watch a TED talk. You won't feel like you've wasted your time after that.

3. If they attack you, stay calm, indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment. The odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative.
4. Don't become them. If they are negative, be positive. If they lie, tell the truth. If they speak behind your back, speak to their face. Always lead with example, because they might not simply have the skills to do that.

1916,5MgBikgcWnY,"I really believe in everything he has just said. It is important to avoid procrastination guys. I am telling you this because of my life experience. I moved to Canada when I was 20 years old and my life has changed completely. I was studying computer engineering in my home country and was about to complete my 3rd year when my mother took the decision to move to Canada. It was really difficult at the beginning because of the language and culture. My knowledge about English was probably between 30% and 45%, so I had to invest part of time studying English.  I proposed to myself that I had to learn the language  at a university level  in 1 year, and it worked. I still need improvements, but I feel really proud of myself because I was able to learn the language. After having learned English, I applied to University of Toronto to study Computer Science,  and since the semester was going to start on September of the following year, I took that year to study everything about my career. I took my time to study advanced functions, calculus, physics and programming. What do I mean about all of this? You can learn everything you want if you really want to. The crucial part of all of this is to believe that you can do it. I personally do not believe in what the science says about the ""SPECIAL KIDS"". We all are smart beings that have the same capacities to learn everything we want. You can do it guys if you are willing to take the effort.

So you never really feel like you have enough.
That's why I really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have.
This is especially true of us in the first world.
We get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff, that they are ""living the dream"".
But the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles.
And if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach.

The irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most.
They have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need.
So when they come to live here and get a job, they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff.

I‚Äôm an engineer and I work with batteries as a hobby. There are two kinds of batteries that are LiON. One is ‚Äúprotected‚Äù and the other is ‚Äúunprotected‚Äù. 

The protected ones prevent over-charging and over-discharging as well as over current. The unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection. Guess which people choose for their vaping. 

Lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density. They are damaged by over charging and over discharging. Cheap chargers don‚Äôt behave and will over charge. Few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge. 

So why don‚Äôt people use protected cells?  Generally those have too low current to make vaping possible. The current draw to instantly heat to 200C is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in, causing things to not work or work much more slowly.",5636.0,2.0

O - Organise: ask ""Where will I use this information?""
D - Distill: progressive summarization
E - Express: show your work",375.0,1.0
2114,K-ssUVyfn5g,"SUMMARY NOTES:
00:00 Intro
-The problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information.

-The ""second brain"" system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information.

-The ""second brain"" system has helped Ali in his own life, and can hopefully help others as well.

-The ""second brain"" system uses CODE as an acronym to explain its core foundations - Capture, Organize, Distill, Express.

00:41 What is a Second Brain and why should you have one?
- A second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas.

- Building a second brain can help you express your creativity, be more productive and make better decisions. 

- Every job today involves knowledge work of some kind, and a second brain can help you with inputting, processing, and outputting information.

- The methodology for building a second brain has four parts: Capture, Organize, Distill and Express (CODE).

04:56 C (Capture)
- Ali discusses different ways of capturing information, both manually and automatically.

-Ali captures his thoughts and ideas in Apple Notes.

- He also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.

- Having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything.

- Ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day, as well as highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.

08:32 O (Organise)
- Ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in one's learning.

- This means that when you come across something relevant, you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take, rather than creating a new category for it.

- You can still search for specific information using control F or command F if needed.

- This system is especially helpful when working on long-term projects with many moving parts.

11:07 D (Distill)
- Ali talks about a method called progressive summarization, which is basically like highlighting, but on steroids.

- This is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.

- Different than highlighting we're used to in school - it's not particularly effective for  retention in your own personal brain, but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.

11:45 E (Express)
-The ""E"" in the second brain system stands for Express, meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas, you need to share them with the world in some way.

-Sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback, collaborate with others, and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work.

-Without expressing our ideas, they are essentially useless - it's important to find a way to share your creativity with others.

13:09 How my Second Brain has helped Ali
-The course/book has helped Ali become more productive, but also more creative and less stressed in general.

-The system taught Ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts - working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one, most of the work is already done. 

-The system has also helped with his teaching work - he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information.",134.0,2.0

Activities like chess, reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration. I know a Buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment.

I would go to the University library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught.  within 18 months I had the knowledge of an MBA.  By the time I was 20 I started my own company and was a millionaire before I turned 40.  It took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you.  I finally found a banker that would talk to me.

I have done this in California many times and have grown several varieties of quinoa. It takes a small field to get enough to sell but a few plants will give you a few cups of dried grain you can cook for a few meals and some seed to save for next year and the leaves are edible too and can be cooked like spinach. The next time you go shopping at a store that sells quinoa plant a few of the grains. You can even grow it as a houseplant but beware, it grows several feet tall and wide and is prone to falling over when the flowers get heavy. If you try to grow this plant just pause this video and look at the ground they are growing it in. It likes to grow in a mixture of compacted dirt, crumbled rock, and sand in a very hot place where it's occasionally watered. That's what you wanna put in your flower pot and reproduce. Mine grew well in a place where there used to be a gravel walkway that had been overgrown with thistles and nothing else for years. Please grow your own quinoa even if just for fun.

I've been dreaming of opening a coffee shop in my neighborhood over the last 2 years. We moved to a brand new neighborhood without much comercial options within 4 miles.

I was amazed that they trust me enough to do that but at the same time I'm scared to start even though I have a lot of support at church and friends. 

One of my friends owns a coffee shop already on the other side of town and is willing to get me in front of the right people. But again, my family is relying on my income to live. I know it would be great! I just need to find a person I trust to help run it along side with me so I can maintain my insurance career at the same time since it's not demanding at all.",3.0,2.0

Step 1: Build a 'temporary' box house or cave home
Step 2: After playing for awhile and gathering materials, prepare to build your new house
Step 3: Look up some builds people have done for their houses for inspiration

Step 5: Stop playing for 8 months
Step 6: Start playing again, but feel completely lost and confused as to wtf you were doing

You need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are, have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter, often times even understand things like color theory. There is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video, especially an 8 minute one. But as far as guidelines for people who just want a nice house this video is great, pretty much everything is spot on and will make things look good almost every time you build it.





Also if you want to get really into building, I would recommend watching all of Grians tutorials, and once you've gotten to a decently advanced level, watching tutorials from another, far smaller youtuber who goes by Horace - Minecraft. he is an amazing content creator and is incredibly talented in his craft, in my opinion, even better than grian is, though they do build in vastly different ways so there isn't much comparison that works there.",13.0,1.0

Nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos:  it's a huge engineering lift, it takes 20 years to pay itself off, you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts, machine them, weld them, then certify and maintain them over a period of 40+ years.

Their CO2 emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence. Personally I am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable, concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer, but without the emissions. Renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclear/fossil fuels. I would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants, using the same small plots of land. With Renewable, it requires covering vast amounts of land with solar/wind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is wind/solar. This land should be used for farming or nature preserves, not renewables.  If the solar is using worthless land, such as the desert maybe it makes senses, but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaning/maintenance needed due to the dust. Offshore wind also resolves the land use problem, but the costs of maintaining 100s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high.

There are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors, and it seems like we‚Äôll have enough of it for 50-100 years if we generate 40-50% of the energy from nuclear. On top of that, thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts.

Sadly The Netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos ü§£
In addition I can tell that after the Fukushima nuclear incident in March 2011 the EU banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second Chernobyl incident.
The thru regulations Coal was stamped as dirty and Gas was the second best option after Nuclear power.

If we go back into history the North European countries (the Netherlands also) build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages. Since there wasn't a need to change and Gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created. Now there is need so the Coal and Nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need.

From my point of view these things should change:
- Nuclear is the way to go
- Create a military security perimeter around Nuclear power plants
- The western world shouldn't be working with Russia nor China for Energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability.

Furthermore, the ECB cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0% intrest rates, the financial unstable countries (you call them PIGS) Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain and with this structural inflation problems. Russia knows this and the ECB messed up big time.

Last but not least, the EU but also the USA, Canada, Australia and Japan need to stop applying QE, start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years... if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable.

Turns out, above primitive analysis of a business, human ardour drives the stock market and always has, its just evolving, in no small part, as you point out, because of social media causing extreme polarization. The reality is that crypto/stock market is one of the toughest mental games in the world. Building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments. Financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from, and ends up haunting them in the near future. Putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for. We have an obligation and a responsibility to be investing, the market is so volatile now to be depending on the bull run to make a profit or investing without guidance, I advise everyone never to stop investing, never to stop improving, never to stop doing something new and to trade now with an Advisory who has a great experience. Taking this decision some months back has been my best decision so far, i have been able to day trade my crypto assets and increased my portfolio holdings to atop 12.05 BTC in profits with an elementary of 1.09 BTC with trade signal tips and guidance from my Investment Advisor Mrs. Robin Moore.

Turns out, above fundamental analysis of a business, human emotion drives the stock market and always has, its just evolving, in no small part, as you point out, because of social media causing extreme polarization. Solid video. I think it is important for investors to note that while the market is experiencing a mini bear rally and it could be exciting, we are still down roughly 18% on the year. Great race analogy, we are still behind and I think come August with the release of another CPI reading on August should cause some more volatility. In my opinion, this is just the beginning of a recession, BUT overall an opportunity for investors who have time to remain steadfast in a strategy for the long-term! We have an obligation and a responsibility to be investing, the market is so volatile now to be depending on the bull run to make a profit or investing without guidance, I advise everyone never to stop investing, never to stop improving, never to stop doing something new and to trade now with an Advisory who has a great experience.

-Barter system is the alternative to money, but is highly inefficient 
-Money serves as a medium to exchange, store of value, and a unit of account 
-In the past we had the gold standard which connected each dollar to a value of gold
-Stock market is part of the Financial system which is composed of Lenders (corporations and households) and borrowers (households, businesses, governments)
-Financial system = a network of institutions, markets, and contracts that brings lenders and borrowers together 
-3 ways this happens: banks, bonds, stock market
-Banks deal with debt, stocks deal with equity (the difference between the value of assets/ interests and the cost of the liabilities of something owned)
-Financial instrument = a tradeable asset of any kind
-Banks are Financial Institutions = an establishment that conducts financial transactions such as investments, loans, and deposits",265.0,1.0

3498,B95xYAfRCtY,"Hey Erling. Paralegal here. I saw the end of your video, but would still recommend getting an attorney to help with handling this suit. Lawsuits are not fun in any way (unless your the attorney/firm) and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress. My parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always.

Moreover, if the other side has an attorney, they have the advantage of knowing how the system works, such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase (Rule 26a dislcosures, interrogatories, evidence you intend to use at trial, depositions of plaintiffs, defendants, and expert witnesses, etc.) and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge. 

I truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself. Just be careful with how you proceed. Pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done. Also remember it's a legal system and not a justice system. 

This is not legal advice, just a concerned fan. Lawyers or other legal professionals, please correct anything I may have overlooked/unintentionally misconstrued.

I respect you for applying your experience and knowledge into an investment decision and putting your neck on the line by making it public. You may be right on this trade, but if you are right, you better also short the US market as well. Because if the Chinese market collapses, it will pull down the US market with it! Thanks Buddy. Previously Bitcoin has been fluctuating between the $20K and $25K price marks. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms‚Äô liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If you‚Äôre a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility. Well good-news you don‚Äôt have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with Mrs. Robin Moore and the rest will be a good history of profits for you. I have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 17.03 BTC with 5.07 BTC with her trade signal despite the state of the market. Her trade signal yield a lot of dividend only if you are paying attention to her instructions.

I once attended similar and ever since then I have been waxing strong financially and I most tell you the truth. The bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month. They have managed to push the price by more than 100%. The majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction, begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical $2K level. One thing is certain, nobody knows what is going on. Our leadership in the country couldn‚Äôt be any worse, from the press to the feds, they are all terrible. They say you can‚Äôt time the market, but this one was easy to see coming. Every man , woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance. Doesn‚Äôt matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check / checks ASAP. That's the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains. It's unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation, things has been so difficult but BTC/ETH trading has helped me maintain financial stability. Although I believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why I made huge profits with the help of Mr. James Wilson, he is a genius and that is why I always advise beginners/investors to trade with professionals like him. So far I have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from 1.07 btc to atop 13.01 btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by James and I'm an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy.

Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guess work out. Next bull run it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & i need this lower point to get back in, i've small cash on the sideline I don't like that but i refuse to fomo in.

Good luck. Bitcoin price recently completed a two-month surge that resulted in a price increase to over $25,000; consequently, investors are now concentrating on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs next target price. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms‚Äô liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now and trade not to just seat like a baby seater and watch, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If you‚Äôre a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility.

For your info, Suppo. Syscoin has been there for a while.

These base layers will be kept for data availability (DA), to pave the way for their own L2s and , thus, infinite scalability. They are leading the way for modular blockchains.

3698,mLXELbuQNQQ,"< first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying assets at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.

Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short-term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years, it takes the guesswork out. Next bull runs it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & I need this lower point to get back in, I‚Äôve small cash on the sideline I don't like that but I refuse to FOMO in. Our younger investors are scared, they're concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before. My advice to them is this, go all out into trading. Trading is where the bucks are been made. I see the stock market, housing values going down, and crypto going up. Traditional markets are getting recked. The new economy is crypto, not fiat. People want truth, not corruption, contracts not monetary easing.

And if this isn‚Äôt a bear market rally and the Fed achieves a soft landing, Bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now, but we just have to wait and see.  My hope is that by the fourth quarter, the economy will be slowing enough that the Fed says we are going to pause, and then you will see the next crypto cycle start.

If you have been closely watching the crypto <or even invested in it, chances are that you are wondering whether the latest bear cycle is over. The truth is that the market remains unpredictable especially in the long-term. Despite the heavy outflows, Bitcoin still managed to promptly recover, this recovery demonstrated Bitcoin‚Äôs strength despite being stress tested against highly volatile and unfavorable market conditions. Could this outcome be a sign that the market is ready for a bigger recovery? The obvious answers is yes despite how long it might take, it is very important to stay ahead of the market by trading with the right strategy.

And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial.  Few if any rug pulls.

The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades making profits from trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage is understanding, Charts won‚Äôt guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE COMMENTING.

I try to reply often, but ""I don't get step X"" or ""it doesn't work"" is too unspecific and I can't help unless I know exactly what problem you have.


*MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE 4 MOVES*
1:52 has the 4 moves, and you have to be able to do this to understand what ""4 moves"" means when I use it again later on.

*COMMON FIRST LAYER PROBLEMS*
Step 1 & 2. If the side colors of the cross or first layer don't line up the way I showed it in the video, then you need to redo it. Pay attention to ALL of the colors on one piece, and don't just pick white pieces randomly. I talk about this in the video, how I'm trying to match the other colors of the white piece (like white/orange etc.)

*TAKING PIECES OUT OF THE SECOND LAYER*
Step 3. At 5:33 I say ""you should already know how to do this"". I admit this is unclear. You should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer. If this does not make sense, watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment.

*COMMON TOP LAYER PROBLEMS*
Step 4. If you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.
Step 5. There should be no problems here.
Step 6. If you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.
Step 7. Finish the 4 moves (don't stop at 3) every time. Turn the bottom (don't rotate the whole cube) to get the next piece. If it STILL does not work, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.

""Why do I need to reassemble the cube?""
Randomly assembling the cube only has a 1/12 chance of being solvable. If you've ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces, then that can be the problem. If stickers have been switched, you will have to switch them back.

The least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because Magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so it's not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him, rlly left a bitter taste but I'm soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament, he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring.",53.0,2.0

Schade das sie die Notch nicht lassen bis sie komplett unter dem Display verschwindet.

5004,cqwpLa7eN54,"I feel like getting rid of the mini was a stupid decision on there part. I feel a redesigned little bit bigger 14 mini would do really well. 
I also see no reason for anyone to upgrade. I upgraded from a 12 mini to a regular 13 when I switched carriers. I can personally say the phones are nearly Identical in every way. If thats any indication of what to expect from the 14 line, I would say if you have an 11pro, any 12, or 13 model theres not much of a reason to upgrade. IOS 16 isnt a design overhaul anything. Ill be keeping my iphone 13 for a long time. 
The watch saying not to buy one is kinda dumb. If you can find a series 6 or 7 buy it especially when you can get a series 7 for around $280-$340 brand or refurbished from apple. Instead of getting the new SE which is essentially a series 6. 
I think upgrading the watch or Iphone this year is already a skip.
The product to be most excited for is the 10th gen ipad. Getting way better features. I will def be upgrading my mini 5 to and ipad 10th gen especially since it‚Äôll have usb-c. I wish they would do the same with the iphone, airpods & apple pencil.

5025,JV_twMJbCik,"One of the best reviews I've seen for the M2 Air. Very grounded and realistic.
The base model is definitely not future proof with apps and services getting hungrier, but an upgraded M2 (16/512) would be a delightful machine to work on for several years",1.0,2.0
5026,JV_twMJbCik,"It would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16‚Äù model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz; not great, but I would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if you‚Äôre viewing movies. It sucks that Apple has made that limitation, but is that a limitation on the Thunderbolt or SoC ü§î? I feel that the argument that many people don‚Äôt use a dual monitor setup is not really true, especially in the work place. My sister uses dual monitors working from home, and she uses one of those mini-work towers. The thing that tempts me the most about the Air, is the weight, portability, and the amount of power (given specific specs), it‚Äôs more or less well-rounded. However, if I‚Äôm bumping up the storage and unified memory, I wouldn‚Äôt be that far off from the M1 Pro 14‚Äù MacBook Pro price. Strangely, the 14‚Äù would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13‚Äù non-retina MacBook Pro üòÖ. The only cool thing about that model is the upgradability, but even that is a novelty that‚Äôs losing it‚Äôs veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to. I‚Äôm hanging onto it as my backup computer. Really ought to start saving for a more up-to-date laptop. The smudging thing is annoying from what I see. It‚Äôs an awesome color, but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all. Besides the size, portability and power, not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that I‚Äôve yet to experience.

That capability would be a major draw for people who love hearing the best quality audio to upgrade their iPhones.

Btw, I really don‚Äôt think AirPods Pro 2 will outdo the audio quality on the upcoming NuraTrue. Nuraphone‚Äôs specs are insane. I encourage people to go check them out and pre-order to save money. The Kickstarter is over, but I think they can still be pre-ordered. Nura‚Äôs Nuraphone (their over ear and in ear model ‚Äî yes you heard me right!) is still the best audio on the market 5 years after it‚Äôs release. The NT Pro is going to be the closest experience to that in an IEM, plus additional capabilities the Nuraphone doesn‚Äôt have due to its now outdated hardware. I use them daily.

5232,xf2DPY3vGto,I have been an Android user for 10 plus years and especially with Samsung devices the OS system has drastically improved. I went from a Galaxy s10e to the s22 ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip.

It's also extremely unfair to make this video Android vs iOS because iOS is just on iPhones while android is on several phones, some astonishing, some horrible. They should've picked a battle like Samsung Android vs Apple iOS. It should of been a fair fight, but it sadly wasn't. I also don't like how they left out a lot of Android's features like USB-C, newer technology and tricks, and features like Quad HD displays that perform amazing. Very unfortunate and disappointing to see Mrwhosetheboos and Marques do it like this; felt very bias and unfair.

To keep going further, Arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while Marques was on here, he was more accepting and less opposing to him, showing bias as he is a fan of MKBHD.
To keep going even further, they also stretched out points in favour for Apple by a lot, like the Software Support, which yes Apple has Facetime, iMessage, and more, Samsung and Android are greatly improving their technology; and Google message is to Apple's level too. I feel like this video should've had an as wide focus on Androids features then it did with iPhone features.

Great videos, but I'm very disappointed unfortunately, and this comes from someone who used iPhone and Android for years.

>> Final thoughts: This was very bias  towards Apple, this video should've not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it. This video was a comparison on sole facts, so don't stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other.

ALSO. Very important is compatibility - people with an Apple setup can be more comfortable with an iPhone, but PC users.. can't really use all the perks of iPhones unless they get such a setup. Which is.. much more costly.

5302,NO49tLohULQ,"I've had both iPhone and Android and one of the key factors of me deciding to stay with iPhone was that you can always rely on them to put their newest iOS on every device. The only company that can use iOS is also Apple, so there's not 5 different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which Android device is best. Additionally, Apple may be ""late to the party"" with certain things, but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know it's going to work significantly better than the competition. Apple may be more costly, but I'd rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway.",32.0,2.0
5303,NO49tLohULQ,I've always been with Android until earlier this year and made the plunge and got the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. I doubt I will ever go back to Android now.

I kind of want to get an iPad yet I've been going back and forth in my mind all week which to get. Go with Apple or Samsung.  Right now I'm still using Fire HD from Amazon.

Their products tend to be like the durables/home appliances that is made to last and not be replaced. I just want to highlight the part on your video where Samsung is mocking Apple for ‚Äúsame design‚Äù practice, and I think, they are doing that now too because there is a benefit from it.

Build quality and optimisation is something other rival tech companies fail to prioritise these days.. I have a collection of broken Samsung phones for example, not dropped or miss treated, just phones that became unusable after a couple of years of use.

There are lots of unresolved bug fixes besides mine. If a low percent of customers have a specific problem, they won‚Äôt put time into fixing.

5438,xvNvj7ku5pY,"I am not convinced. I have done some digging into AI myself, genetic algorithms  and such. From what I can tell is that an AI is in essence a function with a lot of variables, x, y, z, etc. It then changes part of the function, via constants to achieve the goal. If it doesn't match it well enough then it tries slightly different constants and arrangements.

What I'm getting at is that there is nothing functionally different from an AI and a basic algebraic function. Y = X would then technically be a sentient being by that definition.

Finally if one says that we are just genetic and chemical robots or functions as well we then come to the point that emotions are experienced via chemicals and receptors to give an AI the ability to feel pain, sorrow, longing, grief, greed, and the like is terribly inhumane.

A super ai that spans across several different fields does not require the ability to experience emotion or even to have its own goals beyond running calculations for humans.

As such, an A.I who doesn't understand love or attachment is an which does not care for either and will willingly do what is logical (even if it leads to suffering) in order to achieve an objective.

5642,u987sQrDsSM,"Unfortunately Google has no clue how to measure ""helpful."" I can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top.

Google could simply remove the top N content farms to improve search results.  Look at the fake DIY and cooking sites on YouTube. Google could push them to the bottom, yet they are often pushed to the top. 

Content farms have high production value and low value content, but users will go first for slick looking.  And the kicker, Google generates revenue from ads on those pages. Put simply, incentives are not aligned for Google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content.

For example, before I go on a long drive to a destination I have never been to before, I always check the routes on Google Maps by zooming in for both satellite view and map view. Then figure out if those routes are safe to take or better to take a longer one. It's unfortunate these two groups of people went through what they did. So it's a lesson for everyone to be mindful before setting out to unknown territory.

I'm sure there are many more like him on our planet, and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live. Rather, than some who are here for their personal gain, and greed, not thinking of the future past their own. Something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world WITHOUT our approval as a whole, and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets, letting drugs go rabid, people starving including myself at times, because the cost of food is out of reach, allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have, allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you can't afford your own apartment. Something must be done, both at the state & government level. 

I have trust in Elon. He may not have all of the answers, nor should he... Just the fact that ""truth"" matters to him more than anything, shows that you can get onboard with his ideas, and plans for a better future for us all. Christina",14.0,2.0

Thanks to your tips, templates of speaking and reacting to hard questions and your infectious energy I managed to switch industries from food production to accountancy industry with no prior experience. The twist is I was informed day prior to the interview that I will have to talk in my native language ( which I only use to speak to my family for many years now ) instead of english. So I translated my answers, went to the thing and landed the job! They even loved me speaking about my weaknesses which includes social anxiety. I went to your site too, really good content! So thank you again!

To all who are got an interview ahead- PRACTICE PRACTICE and then PRACTICE more. Watch Richard's videos, personalise your answers, list sticking points to each question so you remember most important things and learn to answer them in different order. Better yet, visualise the thing going smoothly over and over again so you can condition your mind to calm down, sit in a chair dressed in a suit and train that way to simulate the interview. That helped me great deal, even though there was a point I wanted to run away I had a mental safety net of polished answers and hours of conditioning. Good luck all!",29.0,2.0

 -Mr. Davis is ready to interview now.
 - thank you
 -hello Mr Torrus, nice to meet you. 
 i'm tom Davis, the manager of LCI software. 
 -nice to meet you Mr Davis
-first i'd like to congratulate you on passing our aptitude test. 
you did very well. 
-thank you.
-so, how did you hear about this job?
-i saw an advertisement online. 
i clicked on it 
and it brought me to your company's website, 
where i applied for it.
-makes sense.
what do you know about our company so far?
-i've read on your website 
that for over 10 years LCI software has delivered professional services.
on software development projects for clients all over the world.
i can tell from the pictures and client testimonials on the website that you do great, 
quality work. 
-yes, we always try to do quality work. 
the software products we build help many brands transform their businesses.
So, tell me about yourself. 
-i completed a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Biology 
and a Master's Degree in Environmental informatics. 
i managed to get a job in the environmental engineering industry.
but i soon realized i wasn't cut out for that job 
and decided to move to a different industry.
i decided to take the path of a software developer.
-wow, what determined you to make such a bold career shift?
-i've had a great enthusiasm for technology since an early age.
i've always loved computers and gadgets and enjoyed building them and taking them apart.
i took online courses endorsed by high-profile universities and studied how to code. 
i have a few official software certificates.
i started by building websites for people i knew. 
it helped me build a portfolio of projects.
i got my first IOS development job at a software agency called tech services.
i had the opportunity to learn more about the software- building process there.
But, since there were not too many projects at that agency, 
after two years i decided to look for another job.
i soon started to work at an international startup company, Soft Solutions. 
it was a good chance to join a team. 
i've been able to use my training and experience fully at this company.
i gained experience in many things like teamwork, 
time management and quick decision making.
-how long have you been working for Soft Solutions?
-i've been working there for three years.
-why do you want to leave that job?
-i'm looking for a company where i can contribute more and grow. 
i'm ready to take the next step of my career.
-what exactly made you apply for this job at our company?
-i can see that your company has much future growth potential. 
i would love to grow my career at a company 
that has a great reputation in the software industry.
-what are your strengths? 
-my strengths are persistence and courage. 
i give my all to achieve my goals in spite of any hardships 
i might encounter along the way. 
i have a hard working nature. 
i'm always looking for ways to improve and grow. 
i'm also a great team player.
-can you provide an example of how you acted as a team player?
-i always tried to help my teammates complete their tasks if i had completed mine.
whenever someone needed to leave earlier, i would offer to cover for them. 
i'm willing to do whatever it takes for the team or company to succeed.
-great! 
so... what would you do if you didn't get on with someone on your team?
i would try to sort things out in a calm and rational manner. 
i would do my best to get on with that person for the sake of the team.
-what are your weaknesses? 
i can be a bit too straightforward at times and sometimes that hurts people.
but i'm working on this, and try to stop myself from being overly direct.
-where do you see yourself in five years?
-in five years, i'd like to be seen as someone with deep expertise in software development.  
i hope to be offered the opportunity to take the lead on some projects.
-there are definitely promotion opportunities at our company, 
depending on your achievements and expertise.
do you work well under pressure?
-usually i don't panic and manage to maintain self-control. 
there were many tight deadlines and stressful situations at my previous jobs.
i always put in extra hours and did my best in meeting the needs of the clients.
i've always delivered high quality work and respected my deadlines.
-interesting... 
can you tell me about a recent accomplishment or success you had?
i was part of the team that built the Louis kitchen app.
with this app, it's easy to order your favorites, even when you're on the go.
i love creating something that people can interact with and enjoy.
-that's quite impressive, i must admit.
okay, thanks so much for coming in, Mr Torrus. 
it was great to meet you. 
-it was great to meet you too.
-i'll give you a call tomorrow. 
-sounds good. i look forward to it. thank you.
-hello. 
-hello. this is Tom Davis the, manager of LCI software.
am i speaking to Mark Torrus? 
-yes, this is Mark Torres speaking.

And yet, almost no one (if anyone at all) did this at these times. If you have grown up with everyone around you--parents, mentors, peers, teachers, leaders--all thinking one way, it takes a very rare individual to have a conscience of his own. It seems that in a very significant way, we are all defined by the circumstances into which we are born. Whatever your folks tell you and raise you to think, that is what you will be for the rest of your life. Unless you are one out of a million.

I actually had a question about their safety protocols on my list, but decided I wasn't going to ask it because it seemed inappropriate.. so it surprised me when they said it first. I asked it in an interview at a hospital and they were very impressed that I was thinking ahead.

6198,TtGEf_3xhA4,"I agree with the Serma's comments regarding Casemiro's age, but this whole ""30 is the new 25"" is very subjective and depends on the player. Luckily, Casemiro happens to be a player that looks after himself well, and is very particular about how he trains and what he eats. His injury record is phenomenal as well. However, not every player ages like Casemiro, Modric, Ronaldo, etc. Some lack the training and nutritional ethic and often retire 1 or 2 years after 30. So, whereas it's objectively true that sports science and nutritional science in general has come a long way, that doesn't mean that every player is taking equal advantage of it (some don't even have the opportunity to do so). Players like Eden Hazard, Sergio Busquets, are good examples of the counter-narrative in my opinion. On his goals, Casemiro is really good at set pieces and his movement inside the opposition's box is very good - great aerial ability as well. All in all, Real should be glad that they didn't lose him without Tchouameni already recruited. Good luck Tank!",19.0,1.0

6337,dDzp4YXpzLk,"I have PTSD, and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts... It is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened. You keep thinking about the event, and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened, to get it to stop replaying in your head, this can be at all different levels, from avoiding certain types of people, to avoiding groups, public transportation, or in some cases, avoiding people altogether. Violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations, but most people with PTSD aren't violent, if anything, most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation. I guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs, and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened, and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts.  The idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth, at least, I've never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that, you don't have real flashbacks like hallucinations, you just can not stop thinking about what happened, why it happened, how you could have stopped it, and etc, like anyone in a traumatic event, issue is usually, it goes away after a bit, where in PTSD, you still keep dwelling on it years later.",25.0,0.0

Not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint. Plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes. Most pencils had a high lead concentration, hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil. House roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water. I could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile. Solder usually 60/40 lead - tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment.

6580,ExvEIOWB-H0,"So there's been some conversations here about my use of the term 'Viking' and who it refers to. I think it's important to start off by saying that these videos aren't made for university-level history buffs or the like. They're designed for people trying to learn about historical periods they know little about or are revising for exams (A-Levels, GCSEs etc.). Since I base my videos (where applicable) on British teaching standards I think it's important to note that that the use of the term 'Viking' and 'Scandinavian' are allowed to be used interchangeably at this level. At the level of a Bachelor or Masters degree, absolutely not. That level of historical nuance isn't required here.

Yes, the technicalities of historical analysis demand that certain terms be used only under specific circumstances. But not here. These videos aren't for in-depth historical analysis nor do they claim to be a definitive history of the Viking Age.  The people commenting that 'Viking' was not used accurately are largely correct. However, in the context of who this video is for, it matters more that other information is included and those watching not be bogged down by technicalities. These videos are here to build a foundation from which people can research further. There are other channels if you'd like in-depth and dry discussions of terminology.

Her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind. She says that before her farm was confiscated by the CCP (her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth, but they really didn't have a choice in the matter) there would always be 'distant relatives' and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go, had no money and were starving. My grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide. At some point she housed and fed more than 15~20 of them. For many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to Hong Kong which was free from the troubles of China at the time. Many had heard of the prosperity that the British Colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie. 
Some years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter Hong Kong when the Government at the time announced they were issuing ID Cards for citizenship. Albeit, his heart still belongs to China as the indoctrination that generation was subject to, to them was really profound. He would often complain to his children ""why do all of you not love China?!"" and they would retort ""if you love China so much what are you doing in Hong Kong?"" to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer.
I asked my Grandmother once ""do you think Mao Zedong is good?"" and she enthusiastically answers without a second of hesitation ""Yes! Yes, he's wonderful!"" and started blurting out the first few phrases of the Chinese national anthem in song. I guess it's why that generation is called the ""Lost Generation.""",463.0,0.0

Its believed that Thutmose III resented Hatshepsut for sidelining him in the first 22 years of his reign, and after Hatshepsut died indulged himself in a bit spite that was aimed at his stepmother when he tore down her statues and removed her images from temples and other important structures.

Thutmose III was considered very studious and he studied a lot during his aunt's tenure as pharaoh and he became widely respected for his learning. At this time he also gained renown as commander of the army and made a name for himself as a good general who was also wise in victory.

6753,j4kI2h3iotA,"As someone who studies convict leasing in Tennessee, this is a great video. Just a couple corrections:
1. Tennessee prisoners were NOT sent to Birmingham. They were leased to Tennessee Coal and Railroad Company (it's a little more complicated than that, but we can go with that for simplicity's sake) who used prisoners in their mines in Tennessee. After convict leasing ended in Tennessee in 1896, Tennessee Coal and Railroad moved its headquarters to Birmingham and continued using forced prison labor there, but those were Alabama prisoners, NOT Tennessee prisoners. 
2. States absolutely used convict leasing to make money. The lease on the Tennessee State Penitentiary could not be sold for less than $100,000 PER YEAR beginning in the mid-1880s. That would be over $2 million per year in today's money. 
3. Selling crops after sunset was specifically illegal as a means of controlling sharecroppers. The idea was that sharecroppers might sell some of their crop outside of their contract with the landowner. They would need to do it secretly so that the landowner didn't know, and would probably do it at night to prevent witnesses. Hence why selling crops after sunset was illegal.

I'm no expert on Goethe but I also understand he completed the colour wheel which Isaac Newton started.
It is important to understand that in Goethe's time there was a 'Romantic movement'; nothing to do with the definition of the word today, but rather as best described as the counter enlightenment. Goethe was an early proponent of its ideas and was part of a group in the late 18th C called 'Sturm und Drang' (Storm and Stress), a small group including Schiller, of 'angry young men' who embraced the Ideals of the Romantic movement.
By the way, if you haven't done a video on the Romantic movement please do.
The Romantics embraced much of the opposite of what they saw in the enlightenment, such as science and rationalism, and its clinical, dry, detached way of categorising humanity and the world.
The Romantics were not an organised group as such. One of the best descriptions of (the Romantics) was written by my old Philosophy teacher - ""The declared aim of the romantics was to tear down the artifices of 'culture' and 'rationality' which barred the way, both historically and personally, to a ""return to nature"": this is nature the unbounded, wild and ever-changing, nature the sublime and powerful. Were humans to behave 'Naturally', freed from the artificial constraints of cultural convention and morality, then it was proposed that the truth of human life would be revealed, and humans could live a nobler life. In the name of nature, the romantics worshipped: liberty, power, love, violence, imagination, irrationality, the Greeks, the 'primitives' or anything that aroused their emotional responses, while in actuality they worshipped emotions as an end in themselves.""",43.0,1.0

6902,Lr6DYLBkyG0,"I think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself  in your ""death 
bed"" every now and then . To prepare yourself for this,  you must read 
the 9th chapter of "" The Death of Ivan Ilyich""  again. Just a very short
 chapter where Ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed.  He 
suddenly  hears the voice of his own soul saying:
-What do you want? What do you want?
He says:

-What do I want? To live and not to suffer.

So his inner voice says:

- To live? How?

- To live as I used to- well and pleasantly. 

- As you lived before, well and pleasantly?

Here is how Tolstoy continues:

"" And in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant
 life. But strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant 
life now seemed at all what they had then seemed_ none of them except 
the first recollections of childhood. There , in childhood, there had 
been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live 
if it could return. But the child who had experienced that happiness 
existed no longer: it was like a reminiscence of somebody else. 
As soon as the period began which had produced the present Ivan Ilyich, 
all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned 
into something trivial and often nasty"".

So as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and 
darker.  He basically realises that his entire life had been a lie, he 
lived for what the others expected from him; for money, power and status...He wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no
 way back!

Indeed we all must keep Ivan Ilyich in mind every day. Just consider how
 fast the time goes by.... How much of it do we really spend seriously 
thinking about our lives? Very little indeed... Because it requires a 
certain level of focus and depth, which we don't have most of the time.
That's why this scene is a great reminder. 

So as we make the ""Death bed  exercise"" I have just mentioned, we can 
use the very questions that Ivan Ilyich's soul was asking him.
I think people who live well, deal with their mortality better. So doing
 this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better.

Thank you for this wonderful lesson. I love Tolstoy!",1174.0,1.0

I once asked him how he did it and he replied: ""Don't think too much. Just let the book take you away. If you feel like coming back to it for a deeper reading, that's when you'll read slowly and with a more analytical eye. But not every book will be worth it. And sometimes you might not be ready for a deeper run through it, so no point in forcing it.""
I kinda get it, because when I was learning English I would read books in English without understanding most of it. At the end of the book I understood what it was about, even though I didn't get everything. But I just have a bad habit of wanting to know everything, and get everything right the first time.

Seneca thought our time was better spent developing a deep understanding of ideas that are truly important to us rather than surveying a wide range of opinions without deep contemplation and reflection.

Recently I read The Iliad, a book that I had given up once before, and which I knew near to nothing about. I skipped the introduction, which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it. I was initially constrained by the idea that it was a ""difficult book"", but over time, with some paced reading, I found myself really curious about what would happen next. I knew of course that I was doing a ""light reading"" of an overly analyzed book and that I would miss a lot of detail. But I still enjoyed it and after finishing it I went back to read the introduction and found it _incredible_, since it made me think critically about things I had read or notice stuff I missed.

""Being a bird ain't all about flying and shitting from high places.""

""It requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mother's womb, and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood, to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear. It has required thirty centuries to learn a little about his structure. It would need eternity to learn something about his soul. It takes an instant to kill him.""

""Of all religions, the Christian should of course inspire the most tolerance, but until now Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.""

""Religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool.""

""Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.""

""If you have two religions in your land, the two will cut each other‚Äôs throats; but if you have thirty religions, they will dwell in peace.""

""What can you say to a man who tells you he prefers obeying God rather than men, and that as a result he's certain he'll go to heaven if he cuts your throat?""

""Behind every successful man stands a surprised mother-in-law.""

 ""It is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge.""

""Animals have these advantages over man: they never hear the clock strike, they die without any idea of death, they have no theologians to instruct them, their last moments are not disturbed by unwelcome and unpleasant ceremonies, their funerals cost them nothing, and no one starts lawsuits over their wills.""

""The human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe.""

""Our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the well-trodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road.""

""Every man is a creature of the age in which he lives and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time.""

""Despite the enormous quantity of books, how few people read! And if one reads profitably, one would realize how much stupid stuff the vulgar herd is content to swallow every day.""

""I have wanted to kill myself a hundred times, but somehow I am still in love with life. This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our more stupid melancholy propensities, for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away, to loathe one‚Äôs very being and yet to hold it fast, to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away?""

""Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.""

""The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing.""

I do think the debate was played too much on Shakespeare's terms and turf, in part because Prof. Smith politely allowed it to stay there. Some thoughts:
- Biographical silence favours Shakespeare (about whom we know relatively little) than Milton, whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss, weakness, aspiration, perseverance, hatred, and love. This was hardly raised.
- So too historical context: Shakespeare comes clearly out of an Elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like Marlowe and co-developed by writers like Jonson; Milton obliterates the norms of mid-17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism.
- Drama favours interiority, and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness. Milton and most literary history would not have thought it so; though the actors brilliantly depicted M's dramatic imagination in Paradise Lost, his goal, unlike Shakespeare's was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind, but to go beyond them. His theme is not finally the human, but the human-in-the-cosmos.

In short, we judged here whether Milton was better according to the criteria of Shakespeare. Shakespeare will win that battle with anyone. Milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether you're asking the right questions in the first place.",24.0,2.0

There are some truly trash novels in existence, but you can read something like Normal People and take something away from it, like what your mum said about her crime novels. If you have a philosophical/analytical/learning mindset then any book or even trash reality shows can be good places to apply and challenge your thoughts about other people and contemporary society.

But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief.‚Äù

This book was written in 2017 with an international look as  these creators (to encapsulate both artists and architects). In a series of interviews have to explain their method.

The literature review is not an essay, it is not a research paper - the literature review is part of your essay, the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe stand-alone product if you're master's degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for. But regardless of whether part of the research essay or stand-alone product, one thing the literature review does not do is - It doesn‚Äôt prove, state, illustrate, collaborate or develop your main point, that's in the body of your essay. The literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper. Well, what the heck does it do then?

Well, the literature review is divided into the following key terms: first is, the whole idea of what the heck in the literature? The literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic. Now remember I said narrow topic, we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes, you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic, that's the first thing that you need to know. The literature is published, peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic. Second thing, the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed. What the heck of a review, well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it. What is that snapshot going to capture? That snapshot going to capture major concepts, the major point, the major outcome, the major whatever in that source. It‚Äôs not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot. Once you get all those snapshot done, you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of time-line situation, maybe not, but the key years is you‚Äôre going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element, may be on a time line type of situation.

Now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why they're hack are you doing all this stuff. Well, I think there are three reasons, probably, why you're doing all this stuffs in school. In the first one, off course, to improve your own understanding, as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics ¬†into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding, build your background, build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline. Then in of course in this paper, when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject you're going to be demonstrating that knowledge, demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment. But you know, the real purpose of a literature review is, it‚Äôs a reader service, it something you doing as a favor for your readers, what are you doing you are bringing them up to date.

What‚Äôs the first thing you and that old friend do? You ask each other- hey what you been doing all these years? Fill me in, update me, you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in, you updating them. By bringing them up to date, then you can start at the present again. ¬†You see what I‚Äôm saying, you can bring them along that time-line of the path, letting them know the key element, the major concepts, the key element in your life and what you dare? Boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literature's review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas, past scholars, the past researchers boom and then come your idea.",445.0,0.0

Been way too long on the phone right now
What you sayin'? Wanna roll right now
If you don't wanna be on your own right now
Ring my phone 'cos
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
But I'd rather be in yours, yours (Oh)

[Chorus]
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight (Oh-oh)
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours, yours (I'd rather be in yours)
That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours

[Outro]
Been way too long on the phone right now
What you sayin'? Wanna roll right now
If you don't wanna be on your own right now
Ring my phone 'cos
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight (Oh)
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours, yours",22.0,1.0

 My understanding is it's part of a basket of stocks all shorted with the same instrument (and all retail companies. Movie theatre, used game store, towels) and when GME went parabolic the covering that occurred on that single security pushed up the whole basket. I can't talk for other investors but very little of the rest of the basket was mentioned on Reddit prior to the last week of Jan 21. 
Sure, since becoming bagholders people think it's a movement but to start with it was a value play. When I went long gme was $9.18 pre split with $12 book value. When I went long bbby it was $4.98 with huge call option interest at $5 and Ryan Cohen had skin in the game.

____________________________===========
 	I climb the rooftops every morning
And search for life there down below
But there is nothing out there for me
There is nothing out there to see
I send a signal for survivors
Requesting help on where to go
But there is nobody else to hear
The only answer I get is fear

'Cause every time that I return to this place I once called home
Yes, every time the walls cry out, you're the last one - you're alone

Oh ‚Äì is there anybody out there?
There must be someone else like me
Oh ‚Äì is there anybody out there in the cold?
Come raise your voice and set me free

I wander streets that once were crowded
I'm searching houses that were homes
But there is nothing out there for me
There is nothing out there to see
I'm fighting off the dread that haunts me
But in my empty heart it grows
'Cause there is nobody else to hear
The only answer I get is fear

And every time I raise my head, panic stares me in my face
Yes, every time I try to think, I get trapped inside a maze

Oh ‚Äì is there anybody out there?
There must be someone else like me
Oh ‚Äì is there anybody out there in the cold?
Come raise your voice and set me free

I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot
You better believe it held a whole lot.
I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame
Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.

I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes
They did nothing but give me regrets.
My mom had arthritis could not walk around
I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.

I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack
 After I smoked some to me it came back.
Soon I decided prices were high
I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.

I bargained for seeds from smokers all around
 Got in my truck and drove out of town.
I walked through the woods where wild birds nest
 Found me the meadow I thought was the best.

I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds
Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds.
I watered at night with a five-gallon pail
 Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.

Seven months went by; I thought I would die
Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky.
At night I went out, in a camouflage suit
 Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.

I hung it up to dry where it couldn‚Äôt be found.
Came back and got it, when it had turned brown.
I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags
Called all my friends and passed out free drags.

In less than a week my crop was gone
 I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!

Fill it with water, swish your potato pieces, lift out the basket and dump and refill the water until it's clear.  Then dump the water and spin the potatoes.

10033,8A1XqeiFFgs,"Okay, this gonna be a long one, sorry about that.

I'm French, and there's an interesting fact about France, it's that we are brutally honest. Most other people don't like that, so we are called arrogant, rude, obnoxious, but we are not, we are just honest, and people don't like honesty. When we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other, it's not because we cheat more than you, it's just because we honestly answered the questions. You're probably wondering where I'm going with that.

Well, I was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other, not staying friends with each other, yada-yada-yada, and I can't relate. At all. Because it doesn't work like that here. I still know a lot of female who were already friend in High School (and I'm 40), whenever I see my mother, or my Girlfriend, or my Girl Friends, they are just friendly.

I dunno, it's probably only on screen, but the number of time I saw in TV shows or movies a group of girls being friendly, then as soon as one leave, they all turn to bitch on this one; that's something I never saw in France. They bitch on her while she is here, and she doesn't take it badly, because she does the same.

So I was wondering, why is that ? Why are they still friends if it's different for others, then I realized, because we are honest.

My female friends won't hesitate to look at each others and say ""Wow girl, you look like shit today"" ""Didn't you put on weight recently? Maybe you should work out"" and for me, that's a healthy relationship.

Why does American males manage to stay friends ? Because they trash talk each other, because they are honest, because they say things as they are. Yeah, sometimes we have fallouts, but we mend things,.

Why can't female American stay friends ? Because they are sneaky, they lie, ""Ooooh, you look gorgeous girl"", ""You are so strong, I envy you"", while not thinking any of that. Sooner or later, in any relationship based on lie, the truth will come out, and it's not going to be pretty.",12.0,0.0
10034,8A1XqeiFFgs,"I know that women brought us into this world. But be honest, if that was the case then all women would be doing exactly what their mothers wanted them to be growing up. Just saying all women can relate to ""mom guilt.""",10.0,1.0

Betaal is described as a creature/monster who questions king Vikramaditya's strong sense of justice. Betaal is little bit crazy, and inhuman (addressing Achara's concern), and that's the vibe I'm getting from Hrithik's Vedha's unlike Sethupathi.

And in the car, the lawyer lady told him to stop talking to Young Woo about whales entirely, which is not what he did. He didn't listen to her cuz he doesn't find it annoying. The reason he set up a specific time is so she wouldn't call him while he's in the bathroom or if he's busy.

So basically the movie is about how a scenario like that would play out if the ""detective"" was an aging hippy with no sense of self-motivation who is completely unqualified to deal with it. 

At the time it came out, people compared it to their previous film _Fargo,_ which while it had distinctly Minnesotan humor it was still a serious ""true""-crime story in the end.

Re Mav's F-18 being unable to fly again after his 'demo', pulling Gs damages the structure of aircraft. Too many Gs will break the airframe immediately, but even pulling less than that limit will still do damage: microscopic cracks that build up over time, invisibly weaking the airframe until it breaks, sometimes during normal non-extreme flying. To combat this, all aircraft have a rated 'G-life', that is the maximum cumulative number of Gs they can pull in their lives before they're retired as a precautionary measure. Mav's extreme maneuvers during the demo may not have broken his F-18 immediately, but they may have used up so much of it's G-life that it's effectively scrap anyway.",43.0,0.0

10135,rVZ-PvlZgkE,"My theory here:

- That ""plant creature"" could possibly be that Fungus but in a more mutated form. As seen previously in the ""Missing Persons"" and  ""Autopsy Report"" videos, whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, they get covered in this black coloured fungus. This fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto (mutating itself onto the dead body). Given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate (100, 1000 or even millions of years at best) and also given that how time passes strangely in the Backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the ""Informational"" video with the date 2/9/1990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished, however it wasn't teleportation but instead time travel. That researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the ""Presentation"" video with the date 5/8/1990 when the alarm rang out and CCTV footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by Async. So by this logic, the whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time. The creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash. As seen in Kane's secret video of ""9780415263573"", this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed, the driver wasn't able to push the brakes in time to stop the car. Thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage. The driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there. The fungus grew on him and later the entire room in it's mutated form. Also it sounded like the creature was yelling out ""Help"" in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room (which was seen in the ""original found footage"" video and later the ""Pitfalls"" video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of it's last victims and in this case, even it's originator which is the driver). It's all just a theory which I just came up with. Don't take it canon lol.",325.0,0.0

I saw this opening night in IMAX and it was one of the absolute best moviegoing experiences of my life. The sound of the jets flying by, the literal feeling of the vibrations in your seat when the G forces kick in, and especially the visuals of seeing everything from the point of view of the pilots. I legitimately believed during the final dogfight that Maverick was going to die, so few movies today make me believe that!

On top of all that, the story is so freaking amazing. The theme of showing how fighter pilots are still needed even in the age of drones, the story of Rooster learning to not just forgive Maverick but to let go of being so overly careful in his flying and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think just fly‚Äù. And of course the most emotionally powerful if the movie when Maverick visits Iceman. Even though he has retired due to his throat cancer and has difficulty speaking he still managed to give an absolutely heartbreaking performance.üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

10190,F81Bz6A4P20,"""House of the Dragon"" is inspired by George's book called ""Fire and Blood"" which tells the story of what was known as one of the most violent wars and power struggles within the Game of Thrones universe, the tragic fight was called  ""The Dance of Dragons"", and this event takes place 100 years before Daenerys.
The funny thing about the book is that it is a kind of book within the universe itself, that's because ""The Dance of Dragons"" was a historical event and when reading the book as it is written, the impression one gets is that any inhabitant of Westeros could go to the library and read the same book telling about what led to the dance of the dragons to happen.
And yes, it was just a book that tells about this event and it is already finished, so for the series we can expect less seasons than GOT, and a more complete story, different from the ending of got that was not written by George since the books still are not finished, but all the characters of ""House of the dragon"" were created by him as well as the basis of the story although some things can and will have some changes.

10191,F81Bz6A4P20,Targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams. The only reasons the house survived the doom of Valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to Dragonstone. Even in Game of Thrones Dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs. That's why she did it.

10193,F81Bz6A4P20,"My underestanding is that the wife wasn't going to survive either way. So it was a matter of ""letting the gods take them both"" or actively killing his wife to save the baby. An absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it. We've seen some horrible stuff, but her death scene was up there with one of Ramsay's scenes. I also think, given recent political events in the US, it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from Marvel. Not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come.

Also, I hear this series will be far more morally grey than Game of Thrones ever was. Daemon gives me Ramsay or Joffrey vibes, but he'll be much more complex and less villainous. While he seems to operate on self-motivation, his violence isn't wanton or random like Joffrey or Ramsay. So I picture him being closer to a Cersei/Jaime style character. But if anything he absolutely gives PEAK Targaryen vibes and Matt Smith gives a stellar performance.

I'm really excited to see Corlys Valaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen. A shame we haven't seen much of Rhaenys but I picture her having some of Cersei's chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown. I hate to touch on this, but I know Corlys's racial ""change"" was of concern, and I originally had slight concern myself. Not because some ""OMG WOKE"" bs, but because of the Velaryons and the Targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation, so I prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one. But if you think about it, the light complexion of the Targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins. Furthermore, Valyria was awfully close to the Summer Isles and Sothoryos. So to me, Corlys is more what I would envision the original Valyrians would look like, so it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Especially after seeing him on screen. He seems like a GREAT character already and I think (and hope) he's up there with Davos.

 Otto Hightower gives strong Tywin and Littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all. He *does* seem like a *type* of man-of-honor, but more in the sense of being a strict rule-follower stuck in the old ways.

And then obviously Viserys is the Ned Stark of the series. I LOVE seeing that name reclaimed. And while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity, I'm glad he apologized to Rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her. I especially like that when brought up with the council, the first response was ""There's never been a queen"" but one of the others was quick to chime in with ""Only out of precedent and tradition"". It's nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has ""hah, but she's a WOMAN!"" Maybe Rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had.

Also while the age difference between him and Alicent is a little insane, and I don't like Otto pimping out his daughter like that, I do think they would legitimately treat each other well. Probably erring on the side of Viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it.

10240,l-TO8g3_arc,"Among the parts of the Indonesian anthem included by Novia Bachmid:
 1.  Lingsir wengi comes from the island of Java especially central Java.
 2.  Cik Cik Periuk comes from the Sambas, West Kalimantan.
 3.  Sinanggar Tulo came from Northern Sumatra.
 4.  Ayo Mama from the Maluku islands.
 5.  Anging Mammiri came from South Sulawesi.
 6.  Lalo Ngaro came from Sasak Lombok East.
 7.  Tanduk Majeng came from the Madura islands.
 8.  The last of our national anthem from Indonesia was the one of Mengheningkan Cipta, Shanna Shannon sang in white between the flames.
The one moment of silence Shannon has sung in memory of all the services our former heroes have fallen before us. The song we used to sing any at the time of the red and white flag ceremony. The song creeps us out every time we listen to it.

The bird that flies over that hill is also the symbol of our country, Indonesia. It's Garuda bird.
The eagle's state symbol also has a particular meaning:
 1.  The Garuda has our country's symbol, Indonesia.
 2.  The Garuda's hoof clings to a single Bhinneka Tunggal Ika when it comes from the book of Sotasoma by the Tantular Emphatti that has different meanings but one is also (tribe, religion, culture, and language).
 3.  The golden yellow represents majesty, constantly charging high in the dignity of a people of great and lofty character.
 4.  The number of feathers on the right and left wing is 17, which means the 17th day our country has been free from Dutch and Japanese rule for 350 years.
 5.  Tail feathers of 8 have the sense of August when we celebrate independence day.
 6.  Below the chain of shields connecting with the tail is the number 19 feather and the hair on the neck 45 (showing the figure of 1945, in which our country of Indonesia was free from the Dutch and Japanese rule in 1945).

The instrument is called Sasando and the hat is called Ti'i Langga. Both are Rote Island, Nusa Tenggara Timur. 

Alffy Rev says that the production of a video clip of the Wonderland Indonesia 2 times will take about 8 months, and early in the song, there are Kecak dancers involved with up to 300.

A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money.

I find it hard to pinpoint Daemon, on the one hand he wants to show strength (the city watch part), but then he's also arrogant (the tournament, claiming victory while the fight wasn't over) and straight up horrible (heir for a day?). But on the other hand, he really cares for Rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her, her father would need him more now than ever before, which shows he also cares for Viserys. I think him calling Viserys weak, was his blunt way of telling Viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king, which is in line with what he did with the city watch, he feels like the king should show his strength.

Viserys seems like he's held things together for those 9 years, but this clearly is coming to an end, I feel like he's made a huge mistake by alienating Daemon, this won't make things easy for Rhaenyra, who already has to fight the fact that some people don't want a woman on the throne.

You wake up in a room that you've never seen before. The bed you're lying in is very comfortable. You sink right into it. You don't want to leave, but you want to know where you are. You sit up, and looking around the room, you see that it looks like you're in a very cozy, but very old room. This room has seen many, many things, it seems. There's a mirror to use, in case the person staying in the room would like to fix themselves up to look nice. There is a closet full of clothes, however you see that there is already an outfit laid out for you. If you prefer the feminine choice, it is a beautiful seafoam green dress, with a black and white striped bow and reaches just below your knees, grouped with black mary janes and long, white socks. The masculine option is a suit that consists of the same colors in the most similar areas, with black dress shoes. You put on the outfit of choice and you leave the room. You go down the stairs of the house to find two people. They look like blonde twins. One is a boy, the other is a girl. They are sipping their tea when one of them notices you. 
""Oh! You're awake!"" The boy cries. ""So they are!"" The girl replies. They introduce themselves as Aaron and Anastasia. Aaron tells you that, since you've been asleep all morning, it would be good for you to go outside with them. You reluctantly agree, but all of your worries fly out the door when you step outside. You see a field that looks like it was masterfully painted a nice mix pastel colors by the gods themselves. There are mountains in the distance, and you can also see a nice pond. In the sky, you can see the moons, and even a planet or two. You can even faintly see the stars. There are trees by the pond and one of them has a pair of swings. The three of you walk up to that tree, and you spend the rest of the day playing there, the twins took turns pushing you on the swing. Eventually, night came, and you went back to the house for dinner. Anastasia made the most delicious bread and pasta you'd ever had, and Aaron did the dishes, insisting that you relax as their guest. After a little while, you retired to your bedroom, changed into the clothes given to you, and succumbed to a calm, dreamers sleep, wondering what the next day had in store for you...",376.0,2.0

Now here I am once again at 3 in the morning with a cup of coffee, fast internet, and my own custom PC. It took a lot to get here and I still have a long way to go in life and have uncertainties for my future.

Checklist: 

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrateüíß

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the timeüîã

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyoneüéß

‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.‚òï

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.‚å®

‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy üêà


Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 
You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. (¬¥‚ñΩ` É‚ô°∆™)

sleep: Sleep well at night!!!
Comfy space: Make your study space as comfy as possible! (just not to much so you will fall asleep!!)
TURN OFF YOUR PHONE (Unless all you are doing is work/studying and lofi girl music)
Also open up a window, its great for fresh air!!

sometimes, before studying, you need to remind yourself what you're doing this for.

you're doing this so you can enjoy your life later.

you could even be doing this in hopes of going to university and partying the heck out of a Friday night.

you'll get there
you can do it.
let's try to make it together, eh?  *smiles and offers you a hand*
 

fix your posture,
unclench your jaw,
relax your muscles,
breath in,
..... and breath out.
repeat with me; 
""I got this!""

Damn right! you HAVE got this. believe in yourself <3

reminder: if you are someone like me; someone who is kind of a perfectionist, or if u think ur life isn't ""good enough"" or ""messy""
here's some motivation: life is supposed to be messy, that's what makes life, 'life'. ""the way I see it if you want to see the rainbow you've got to put up with the rain"" -unknown. life is basically an adventure, there and ups and downs and smooth roads. won't it be boring if your life went EXACTLY the way you wanted it? the hard times are an experience, and the present time is a moment to appreciate.
so let's appreciate this beautiful life together, whatever you are going through, you will get through it. The rainbow will be across your head at the right time

11198,n70eobB2TgI,"In the animal kingdom, the ability to hide, disguise yourself, blend in to your surroundings and be unseen not only affords you safety from predators but can also make you a deadly hunter. In the African savannah, Zebra graze on grasses they seemingly disappear into. In the Madagascan jungles, Chameleons change the color of their skin to suit the trees they climb. In the warm tropics, Mantis blend in amongst the foliage as they hunt their prey. 

The Octopus becomes one with the great barrier reef with apparent supernatural ability. Polar Bears and the Arctic Fox disappear in the blinding snow as they scour the arctic tundra. Penguins play, unseen by predators, in Antarctica and the Snow Leopard rules the mountains of Southeast Asia. 

Animal Armory takes a closer look at these fantastical superpowers and the animals that wield them.

If the cost of teaching and training people was passed on to the state, then companies would not have to spend money or time giving their workforce the tools they would be expected to use.

Worryingly, the same is happening nowadays. Many companies complain that people leave college/university and are ""not prepared to enter the workforce"". They want someone else to teach people to be good, efficient workers, so that the employer can make the most of their staff from day 1.",4.0,1.0

Over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories, which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory. Learning style was just one of many. Nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced. Nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories (presented as facts) demanding evidence and proof. Ever. Yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher. So you had no choice. At least whilst being observed!! I became quite cynical in the end because I realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their CV.

11288,XlnspY2wOVw,"Apologies for not watching the whole video.  As a former student and a parent of students, I know the system was broken long before common core.  I remember in college, my English 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide, because I was so deficient on the basics--though I did well in English all through school.  I had to take remedial math, because my high school didn't prepare me for college courses--though I graduated with the required credits.  

Things have gone down since I was a student, and my kids had schools with very high standards, but very low expectations.  That means there were a lot of advanced classes offered--like calculus--but so many ways to accept failure.  They had to take history and social studies, but only had to PASS one!  The policy of ""No Child Left Behind"" was an additional failure, as it meant no one failed or was held back, even though they wouldn't graduate on time.  Kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted.  

Too much government involvement means teachers aren't allowed to TEACH!  We have some phenomenal teachers, who are underpaid, with far too much non-teaching responsibility heaped on them.  Schools aren't just expected to educate students.  Now, they've got to feed them, clothe them, teach them manners and how to get along, look out for abuse, deal with all their special needs, (and accompanying IEPs,) head off bullying, deal with allergies and medical conditions, worry about gender identity and sexuality, discipline fairly, deal with ""helicopter parents,"" check the boxes for college prep, and deal with the ever-present worry over school shootings.  

With all we're expecting from schools and teachers, it's a wonder anyone goes into this profession, or stays once they see the outlook.  

Common core, like No Child Left Behind, is a great idea on paper, that fails in implementation.  My kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were well-educated.  There was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses, and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students.  It meant even more testing for students--to judge whether their teachers were up to the task.  At the same time, they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do better--like tenure.  They promoted the best teachers out of the classroom.  They took away teaching assistants due to the costs.  They increased class sizes.  And they started charter schools--which were experimental programs.  

Imagine if all those billions spent on common core, were used to pay teachers more--and get out of their way.",55.0,0.0

1. Due to the rains, many regions are flooded, families displaced and property destroyed.

2. Transportation is nearly impossible. Some States have still not lifted the lockdown, so trains, buses and taxis are either unavailable, or charge exorbitant rates.

11344,ovxXYMsz37g,"I've been an edtech consultant in Beijing for 7 years. I've also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools. There are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive.

The first and foremost factor I would note is the lack of public discourse. This permeates through every part of society, especially education. If you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you, you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner: inquiry and reflection. In education, this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge. Even in history class there's no critical thinking or reflection involved, it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember. 

The second factor of note is barriers of information. The public does not have (easy) access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content, and even if they did get access, they wouldn't be able to recognize it. On top of that, there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as VIPKids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations. This causes market distortion, and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name (E.G. Wonders) and say that's their curriculum without any plan how to implement it.

The third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge. As stated in the first point, most of the population's education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection. If you've been taught not to question things your whole life, how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies?  How can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences? The result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good (or fishing consultants like me for free content).

The fourth factor is lack of foreign talent. There are not enough QUALIFIED teachers to meet demand. The general population would not be able to recognize one either. Many companies hire Russians, call them American, and slap a 200%+ markup on the course. It's up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content, instruction, and meet the unrealistic expectations the ""decision makers"" (sales people) set for the parents.

The final factor is who the decision makers are. Who decides what ""national curriculum"" is? Starting in 2020, private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the ""national curriculum"". This top-down decision making only exasperates the situation. It also permeates throughout the society. I've been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools.  Most of these decision makers are unqualified, they're sales people at best.
I should also mention that many parents have no clue about education, yet influence the schools with their misconceptions...but this is not the parents' fault. Rather, it's the school's fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program.

As for price... it's simply about demand vs supply.  Lack of foreign talent as mentioned before, combined with a desperate middle class (and higher) trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost. They will pay upwards of 200k RMB just to make it happen for their little Middle Schooler.

Unfortunately I exited the market, partially because the clients I had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problems...mostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum.",108.0,0.0
11345,ovxXYMsz37g,"My sons were in Chinese public schools until 8th and 9th grade respectively.  I am French and their mom and Chinese so we thought it was important they at least attended a few years of school in the local system.  Until the 6th grade, the system does work and teaches them importance of hard work.  now, as bi-cultural kids, they were actually considered foreigners which in a way lessened academic pressure but also caused resentment especially for my older son.  From 6th grade onwards, the pressure becomes pointless and is made worse because teachers and schools are incentivized on class results.  the worst of them will not hesitate to try and persuade weaker students to leave.  Bullying by teachers can also occur.  my youngest son went all the way to the zhongkao and got accepted into a top local high school but then asked if he could go to an international school.  he went to a very selective one but probably has only half the workload of his former classmates.

This 2021 reform only focused on alleviating some financial burden.  what it didn't do is address some fundamental issues with the system:

- Teachers are not incentivized to help weaker students - instead they push them out
- Everything is based on 2 tests:  one in grade 9 and one in grade 12.  These tests are extremely hard but also very narrow and focus on rote learning but do not do enough to help kids develop analytical skills (even if that has improved a bit) - system should be reformed to take equivalent of GPA into account.  this would ease a lot of the pressure
- The last 5 years of high school are spent on passing 2 exams rather than help students grow

There is a little that is learnt in those 5 years to help them transition to higher education.  Yes most of them will have strong language and math skills.  But a lot of it is mechanical.

What I learned through self-defense practice, and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus, and are not an effective way to learn. In self-defense, instructors increase stress by making you do cardio-based exercises to make your body artificially feel stress (accelerated heartbeat, difficulty to breath, difficulty to focus) only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal, but they don't do it for learning purposes. The military seems to do it too in their own way.

11371,zDZFcDGpL4U,"I found this very interesting, and as someone with ADHD-I, I had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it.

It brought up so many points of interest. With in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution, ADHD is considered an epidemic of our time, and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking. From the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses. As time went on this idea continued but in a different way. By the 1920's there was a drive towards raising the standards of living. People were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked, and live in the suburbs in a house, get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style.

But like he said in the talk, this type of trend doesn't work anymore. Styles of life are so divergent and it's obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women aren't going to be stay at home mom's and many can't. Actually during the 60's many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life. And as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living.

As for ADHD it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child. I believe ADHD is both a cause and symptom of behavior, but not always both. Take your eyes for example. You get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly, so you get prescription lenses. You now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription. And no one asks why.

No one asks why are you like this, how did it happen. Or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it. Yes and no. You can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions, but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met. Becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors. Your nutrition, your genetics and your life style. Actually  some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight, by changing their diet and their habits. For instance a child who stays inside all day, watching TV and playing videogames for hours, refuses to eat his vegetables and who's parents or relatives have had glasses, may develope near sightedness.

So in relation a child who has been mentally watching TV and playing videogames all day, not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity, exploring their real world, developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating, interacting socially with others around them, making constant decisions, based on logic, real feelings, and experiences, and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills, in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner. And it doesn't just go for ADHD. This could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty. In varying degrees of course. But it is believed that behavior (in any form) is partially learned and partially developed. And by developed I mean the way your brain developed. How your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works.

Going back to education you can see why this factory mind set can't work for everyone. As well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts, you find contradiction. Most people don't understand the arts. Most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesn't make sense anymore. Truth is that area of education evolved, but only by those who pursue it, would understand. A big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world. The A grade is the pinacle of that idea.  Do perfectly in your education and you get an A. 

Well this doesn't really work in the art world. You still get graded when you do your work and do it well, but school is for practicing the academics. In art you study academics as well, like art history, art Theory, and your use of a medium like drawing or painting. What you don't get graded on is on the things that can't be measured, like your idea, your creativity, and the value of your work. Though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill. But when it comes right down to it, art isn't about any of this or it can be about all of it. It can be about how others value your work, it can be about how divergent your work seems to be, it can be about how well your work matches a subject, it can be about how well you use methods of design, it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people, and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic (AKA art competition or auction). So in a way it is chaotic to the point people can't make sense of it any more, but it is not inherently measurable and perfected.

It is the product of ideas. And ideas are valued above all else. And yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms, and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty.",37.0,2.0

So I spent 5 years believing I had adhd when all I had was this thing called childhood. Eventually in 10th grade I switched to an alternative school and everything Robinson has said regarding alternative schools in his other speeches is spot on. I'm a senior at my alternative school, going to college next year and this school has had a profound impact on me. I'll spare the details, but I just want to confirm that alternative schools are very often the solution and right now what I'm most passionate about is making this education revolution happen and I will do everything in my power to achieve this.

Education can be very useful for employment goals, but there are limits. And we are approaching that limit from a cost to value perspective.

Generation Z is not stupid and they are declining to voluntarily set themselves up for a lifetime of paying back student debt. (Trust me, Gen Z:  you do not want to find yourself in that situation. It will steal years, if not decades, from your life. And you will never get that time back.) 

Also most skills of the high demand and lucrative software engineering tech jobs are not taught in college, but rather can be learned just as easily by anyone with a cheap internet connection and sufficient motovation/focus.

Because of the implementation of reservation, there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into IIMs and IITs be lacking in certain core subjects (Dont assume I am a casteist because I am outlining a drawback in reservation policy. I completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation) and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but, the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who haven't had access to great education in their schools/colleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education.

And Zane thinking it's all back to normal even though it was his fault because he did it all. I also love aphmau in that Google translator outfit it looks really cool it's also really pretty. I like all the random stuff that happens when she's hitting things or even trying to help herself like what the heck and the only one useful in this in this whole video was Kim. I just can't right now I just so funny. But anyways thanks aphmau for making such amazing videos making everyone feel so happy by watching your videos.üíú‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§üíóüíôüíöüß°üíõüíôüß°üòÜ‚ú®,2.0,2.0

The nations are: Plains: boost to farming and gathering resources (get more of them) + they have additional heart in ther region, but they have -1 heart in other regions (so making a nation to defend, rather then attack) Structures: Castle and village next to it
Jungle: Jump higher and get much lower fall damage (can build special sorts of bases, I guess), but -1 heart overall. Structures: Aztec Temple and village on trees
Desert: Loses less hunger bars over time
+ other nations in their region lose 1 heart, but the desert people lose 1 heart in other regions, like the Plains. Structures: A pyramid and a trading post
Swamp: Their potions are more effective and lasting + they don't need to kill blazes to make potions, but they have -1 heart in THEIR region. Structures: Giant witch hut
Islanders (live on their own island) : Faster swimming on boats and themselves, better fishing efficiency, but the isle is little and not much land is fertile (that makes them invade others) Structures: Seaport / Dock and Coastal village. 
Snow: It is very cold there and people are brutal. They are -2 heart s in the beginning, but for every kill they get +1 heart (that makes them an aggressive, unstable society), but they can eat only meat (because they probably have never seen vegetables) Structures: igloo village plus Viking fort
Mountains: Quick diggers (1,5x speed)
Structures: Forgotten mine + dvarvish fortress
The situation of the regions: 
               Snow                  Mountains


Plains                  Islanders              Swamp

-For vocab questions, read the whole sentence, plus maybe the sentences before and after for context. Then substitute in each answer
-Know what certain terms are (7:04)

For two-part questions:
-Look at the second part and highlight all the quotes in the passage
-Then read the first question (only the question) and try to see which quote answers every part of the question
-Compare the quote to the first question‚Äôs answers

For the literature passage:
-Try to be engaged/to have fun
-Read challenging books beforehand

For the debate passages:
-Read the first passage and answer all the passage-1-specific questions while it‚Äôs still fresh in your mind
-Repeat for passage 2

-Especially for the Science-based passages, don‚Äôt infer anything. Use the passage/graphs to back up each answer",1530.0,1.0

12201,PJRhPrLJ4Oo,"First of all, let me clear up the misunderstanding about why Asians do well in life: we do not always send kids off to academic supplements, SAT study classes, etc... Obviously, there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go, but there are a plethora that do just as well, if not better on these types of activities (SAT, ACT, GPA, school, etc...) without any additional help, aside from a practise test book from the local library. That is me, and I can affirm that for many Asian kids, we have an inherent need to do good, make our parents proud (no matter how much pressure we have), and have a high-level job and go to Ivy League schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us. We push for the best because of our work ethic, not because all Asians have ""oh so much money"". For the majority of our parents, as immigrants, it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour, the hard work, the exhaustion, and the prejudice they have faced in the past, all to provide their children with more opportunities. It is not that Asians are inherently smarter, or richer, or more privileged in any ways (although there are those select few), but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today. Asians are no different from others of ethnic origin, to say: Mexicans, African-Americans, Indians, and other ""dis-privileged minorities"" in the States. The only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties. Do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end? I am not trying to start up any racial slurs, cursing, or insultations of any kind, just putting out a thought and consideration for you all. Obviously, there are many successful, talented, and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones, but I am just making a point here: Why would the high-level universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of ""racial preference"" or ""racial advantage""? Note I put that in quotations, meaning I myself do not think that is a fact. There are hard-working and lazy people, smart and ignorant, good and bad in any race, it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public. So tell me, why should one race get more ""sympathy"" or ""preference"" over another? Can we not just all be equal human beings? It is like saying ""red is better than pink!"" Why? ""Oh, because it is true!"" without an explanation. So, what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me, due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade Chinese girl, and I wanted to share the truth to everyone. Thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully, we can all start changing society little by little, with messages like this! No enmities I hope! :)",4.0,2.0

Reading/writing: 710-740
Math: 790-800
Overall: 1500-1540

Edit 1 (a few hours after taking the test): Feel really confident about the math section, reading was way easier than usual, and writing had a bunch of easy questions but had a few that I couldn't figure out the differences (parts of sentence replacement, not grammar)

Edit 2 (1-2 months after taking the test): yea... I forgot about where I left this comment. Anyways I took two SATs, march 2nd school day and march 12th.

2nd: r/w 750, math 790, overall 1540
12th: r/w 760, math 800, overall 1560
superscore the same as 12th

honestly surprised with reading/writing, especially the reading section. I missed 1 reading on the 2nd (but that was 40 subsection so didn't matter) and 4 on the 12th. 5 writing on 2nd and 1 on writing.

Math I missed 1 question due to not reading carefully and 1 because I didn't know how to do it on the 2nd, but perfect score on the 12th.

if I got the reading section of the 2nd and the writing section of the 12th on the same day, I could have a score of 1590.

Usually it will translate to a score of 730-740. I did pretty well on reading (33/52) and writing (40/44) sections. I'm excited to calculate my score and then... I see the horrific truth:
40/44 in writing is translated to 330 (70 points deducted for 4 wrong answers).
33/52 is translated to 280 (Fine).
53/58 is translated to 710 (90 points deducted for 5 wrong answers). 
A total of 1320. Even though I did exteramly good in the writing section, just above averge in reading (which is a totally flawed section but that's another topic), and amazing in the math section I got a just above average score that gives me no chance hypothetically to get into my dream school.

What do u call saying that one test is harder than another  so they can get more wrong. Even if this is true there are so many ways to combat this with still making sure that there is no cheating. This is especially true in the math section where y literally have to change numbers because the concepts that you are testing should be the same or relatively similar. And even though this may be harder for the English section when it comes to the documents and essay there are still many ways to make sure that there is not too much of a differentiation that it would merit a CURVE because there is no other word for what ur doing.,17.0,0.0

Im a Brazilian student struggling if it's worth applying to the US. 
I did a in-depth research, some ‚Äúmock‚Äù sat‚Äôs at home, and have a strong sympathy for certain American colleges' education structure as compared to Brazilian or European universities, which I'm fortunate to have the citizenship in both places. Nevertheless, if I do decide to take this time to apply and commit to this dream that has grown on me in the past few years, I‚Äôd have to eliminate one of my options, whether USP in Brazil or EPFL in Switzerland due to the amount of time set into both. 
While balancing my studies for the local admissions test(Fuvest-USP), the EPFL‚Äôs entrance exams in French, and a few EC‚Äôs, I obtained a couple of 1550+ scores at home following all the procedures as time-monitored tests. I judge my English as near-fluent since I have been taking classes since I was 9. Above all, I have a strong passion for physics, mathematics, and technologies(mainly AI related to physics research).
I also would be prone to take SAT II, and possibly AP exams, as well as the TOEFL to sum up with my 9.6 out of 10 GPA.
My main concern involves my financial background and my lack of extracurriculars related to my major of interest - math or physics with computer science.
I have participated weekly in two educational NFOs since I was in middle school and more recently online with administrative work, some calls, and at the end of the pandemic as a teacher, which I loved; I had acoustic guitar lessons in the same period mentioned until I started piano lessons one year ago; I have been taking English and French private lessons for 4 years; and played varsity state-level soccer, being the captain until the pandemic started. I acknowledge and feel this excitement for applied maths and physics pushing me to possibly pursue a career in academia and live I life I won't regret, however, I awfully believe that my extracurriculars aren't good enough for top 20 schools and I'm inclined to study in epfl where id have an amazing education, but entirely different from what I've expected as the holistic formation to some eclectic interests that I also have in history and art. 
Back to my financial means, I'm entirely grateful for the opportunities that I already have and a possible new pursuit would be limited to an investment of $25,000 per year from my parents. By converting my mother‚Äôs income to USD(~$35,000) we would qualify for 100% financial support from need-based universities, and those would be my goals.
My question is, am I a strong applicant for America‚Äôs A-1 universities undergrad or have I lost my chance by not investing in a passion project?",0.0,2.0

12668,JeTkMdw6RK8,"Truly inspiring video. The presentation is truly flawless, and the few frames of Minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game. I love how you used pocket edition, because its unique and different than most Minecraft videos being published today using PC or console versions of the game, and I really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out. Also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles. I really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base, as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them. Also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding. If you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay, we can find that the player is holding a torch, just like the many around his shelter. This means the torches around the base has just been placed, and shows how you can move forward in life, no matter how dire the situation may seem. In the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area, and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what. Also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning, showing how even if someone is in their home, they are never safe of the dangers outside, and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety. I also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape, which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls. Not to mention the way the player looks out the exit, as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them, thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there, and how even though you may be small compared to the universe, the impact you make can change the world. Another very symbolic part of this film is the ending, where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the player's dedication. It also is in a slightly smaller frame, and black bars replace the outer edges, which show that even though you try your best, there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey, and how much different it could have been if you have done something different, which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of Minecraft as long as possible, without itching ones testicles. The background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt ""blue"" or sad about ending, but still proud of what they accomplished, and is hopeful for what is to come.

A really poetic performance, really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls. I can't wait to see more work from you.

13409,H21zuMPXbkA,"Personally, I think education (or, specifically, a lack thereof) is one of the strongest driving forces behind things like this -- because ignorance breeds fear and distrust, especially in things that are new or foreign.

When I was in elementary school, back in the 70's, I was reading my way through my school's sci-fi section. It was just a few shelves, but it had almost all the classics... Asimov, Bova, Bradbury, Campbell, Clarke, Doc Smith, Heinlein -- and then I got to Verne. I'd just finished up 30,000 Leagues and was getting into Journey to the Center of the Earth when I found a page had been ripped from the book.

Being a good student, I reported it to the Librarian... but instead of focusing on the missing page, she was outraged that I was reading this particular book. It was ""above my level"" she said, and ""too difficult"" for me. This was a hundred-year-old story at this point, and I was pretty sure it wasn't a difficult one to follow -- the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on Creature Feature on Saturdays! But she still took the book away... and over the next few weeks, that sci-fi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there.

A short time later, I overheard her talking to another teacher about, of all things, a ""shooting star"" -- a meteor that many had seen a night or two before. The Librarian was mocking the teacher because ""a shooting star is impossible -- the Heavens are permanent! The stars don't move!"" As the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor, it seemed to both terrify and outrage her. And the longer that conversation went on the more even I (maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time?) realized -- the sci-fi books she had removed weren't above MY level, they were above HER level. She had no understanding of science, and all these sci-fi stories about starships, robots, and alien worlds were things that she just didn't understand... and because of that, they scared her, so she locked them away.

You slowly reach with a finger, it sends a tentacle ... you both touch, sometimes they get frightened and clamp your entire hand, flashing black before letting go, but not swimming away. They are playful, find a shiny pebble, hand it to the octopus, it'll take it, check if it can be eaten ... discard it ... then a few sec after send a tentacle back to the pebble out of curiosity as to ""why did he give me this pebble ... gotta check again for anything special"".

That would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light. In effect, just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving it's structure idle, at its point of origin, but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parent's original quality.

13766,GimCcrwYxdE,One of the coolest things to me about orcas that the video doesn‚Äôt mention is that there has never been a recorded human death from a wild orca. But orcas have been recorded and seen leading humans towards pods of whales to hunt. They might see humans as a potential symbiotic relationship since they‚Äôre known to eat human leftovers from whaling or snag stray fish when fishermen use nets. Just super cool that they easily could attack and kill humans but seemingly have no interest in doing so,449.0,2.0
13767,GimCcrwYxdE,"The Lummi Nation refer to the local orcas as Qwe 'lhol mechen, which means 'our relatives who live under the sea' or 'the people under the waves.' Orcas live in tight-knit families. In most cases, both males and females stay in their natal pod throughout their entire lives (this is especially true for Southern and Northern Residents). Orcas are incredibly intelligent and social. Their limbic system (the part of the brain that processes emotion) is incredibly developed and complex. Each pod uses a distinctive dialect to communicate. They're the only species, besides humans, pilot whales, beluga whales and narwhals, that go through menopause.

Famous Southern Resident orcas (fish eaters) : Lolita, Granny, Ocean Sun, Tahlequah (who made worldwide headlines when she was spotted carrying her dead calf for 17 days), Moby Doll, Shamu, Luna (there's a documentary about Luna called The Whale)

Famous Northern Resident orcas (fish eaters) : Namu, Corky, Tsitika, Eve, Sharky, Top Notch, Springer (the only orca to have been successfully re-integrated back into the wild)

13802,YO244P1e9QM,"Expand to see important notes for this video. 1) This video, as stated in the description, focuses on general functions of biomolecules. The biomolecules: carbs, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, can all can have important functions in the body.  *This is a video about the general function of biomolecules. For your dietary needs, consult with a dietitian or medical doctor.*  2) We mention the popular CHO, CHO, CHON, CHONP mnemonic for major elements in the biomolecules. As we mention, these are basics. There can be more elements (such as sulfur for example in proteins), but we wanted to identify *common elements starting at the building block level.*  At the building block level, *some amino acids lack sulfur* for example. It's not just sulfur. For example, there are lipids that can additionally contain phosphate or nitrogen. The popular CHO, CHO, CHON, CHONP mnemonic sticks with basic elements found even at the building block level. 3) Since this video only uses one character for carbohydrates, one character for lipids, and one character for proteins - unfortunately, when mentioning general functions of each biomolecule type, it isn't designed to show a specific type. We received a great point in an email though that, since our little lipid character is a triglyceride, this can be confusing when naming lipid functions. For example, at 3:52 in the video when saying lipids are part of the cell membrane, it would be much better if we do not show the little lipid character so there won't be any confusion as we do not want to imply that *specific* lipid type makes up the cell membrane. [Phospholipids are a major lipid type in the cell membrane although other types exist as well]. We plan to explore creating individual, detailed videos on lipids, carbs, and proteins where we can show different types.

It means that we, like 'all' mammals, can pivot our shoulders around, not just the arms within the socket. Compare this to birds/reptiles and older Tetrapod groups and you'll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle, with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum. This third bone is the 'Coracoid' bone, and mammals lost it a long time ago... except in Monotremes. On the plus though, like the rigid flight frame of a bird, it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why Platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim (or echidna to dig). Splayed legs, more ribs than other mammals, low body heat,  eggs, venom, etc. honestly make platypus and echidna more like lizards in a furry costume than just a beaver with a duck bill or a pointy-nosed hedgehog.",19.0,1.0

Amphibians that become completely terrestrial without need for water as part of their life cycle no longer meet the definition of ""amphibian"".

Fast running prey animals and predictors are an example.  Size also dictates evolution due to environmental factors.  Amphibians respiratory system is a limiting factor as many don't have lungs and breathe by uptake of oxygen through the skin or primitive lungs.  This limits size.

Along with that here is what I quickly typed down as a sort of SUMMARY, feel free to fix:

ÔÉò William Prout discovered our stomachs have hydrochloric acid and discovered chemical composition of urea. Also discovered food is divided into carbs, fats, and proteins

ÔÉò Carbohydrates are the source of all energy 

ÔÉò Carbs are made of sugars with the simplest being monosaccharides

ÔÉò Glucose, a monosaccharide, number 1 sugar that comes from the sun

ÔÉò Fructose, same chemical as glucose, but arranged differently, and is sweeter

ÔÉò Disaccharides are two monosaccharides put together

ÔÉò Sucrose, fructose and glucose connected, is a disaccharide joined by a covalent bond

ÔÉò Polysaccharides are thousands of simple sugar units

ÔÉò Cellulose is a bunch of glucose molecules

ÔÉò Bread is made of starch and amylase

ÔÉò Our bodies store carbs in form of glycogen in our muscle until we need to use them

ÔÉò We store our energy long term through fat aka lipids

ÔÉò Lipids are non polar and can‚Äôt dissolve in water

ÔÉò Fats are made of glycerol and fatty acids

ÔÉò Saturated fats don‚Äôt have double bonds, while unsaturated fats do

ÔÉò Trans fat do not exist in nature and are unsaturated and bad for the body

ÔÉò Omega 3 fats, unsaturated, are essential but we need to eat them in order to get them

ÔÉò Phospholipids form cell membrane walls to keep bad stuff out and good stuff in

ÔÉò Phospholipids are one end polar and one end non polar

ÔÉò Steroids, a phospholipid made of 4 carbon rings, are used to make cholesterol

ÔÉò Proteins of made of 20 amino acids which do everything for the body

ÔÉò Nitrogen can only be gotten into our bodies from food, via foods high in protein

ÔÉò Polypeptides are formed by long chains of amino acids

ÔÉò The 9 essential amino acids, which are bodies can‚Äôt make on their own, are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine",573.0,1.0

*Glycolysis*

Glucose + 2 ATP >> 2 Pyruvates + Energy.
This energy is used for making 4 ATP (net profit of 2 ATP) and 2 NADH from 2 ADP, 2 NAD+ and 2 hydrogen (probably H+).

*Fermentation*

Pyruvate >> Energy + Lactic Acid.

*Krebs Cycle*

2 Pyruvates + 2 O‚ÇÇ >> 2 Acetyl Coenzyme A + 2 CO‚ÇÇ + Energy.
This energy is used to form 2 NADH from NAD+ and hydrogen.
2 Acetyl Coenzyme A + 2 Oxaloacetic Acid >> 2 Citric Acid.
2 Citric Acid + 4 O‚ÇÇ >> 2 Oxaloacetic Acid + Energy + 4 CO‚ÇÇ.
This energy is used to make 2 ATP, 6 NADH and 2 FADH‚ÇÇ.
So after the Krebs Cycle we now have 10 NADH, 2 FADH‚ÇÇ and 4 ATP (or 6 if you count the ATP spent in Glycolysis).

*Electron Transport Chain*

10 NADH >> Energy + 10 NAD+ + 10 Hydrogen.
This energy is used to pump some protons out of the inner membrane of the mitochondria. They went back through the ATP synthase creating at most 3 ATP for each NADH, for a total of 30 ATP (at most).
2 FADH‚ÇÇ >> Energy + 2 FAD+ + 4 Hydrogen.
This energy is also used to pump some protons. This creates, at most, 2 ATP each FADH‚ÇÇ, for a total of 4 ATP.

_Conclusion:_
_Total ATP created: 38 molecules, if the cell is very efficient._
_2 ATP is spent in glycolysis so there would be at most 40 ATP that went through the steps._
_10 NAD+ were used, and probably reused._
_2 FAD+ were used, and also probably reused._
_6 O‚ÇÇ were used and they became 6 CO‚ÇÇ in the Krebs Cycle._
_2 Oxaloacetic Acid were used and reused._

It should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works. Apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes, and from that, due to their lack of education, they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans. That is not how evolution works, but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology. 

They might just as well have asked ""If dogs are descended from wolves, why are there still wolves?"" Or even ""If Americans came from Europe, why are there still Europeans?"" Just as dogs descended from a population of wolves, so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes. 

What we know is that the first apes evolved in Africa about 25 million years ago from a population of Old World Monkeys. Whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the TOPS of branches, apes evolved the ability to swing, arm over arm, from branch to branch. Evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment. For apes, that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it. At one time there were about 30 different  species of apes in those forests.

Had environmental conditions remained the same, we would still see forests covering the whole African continent. However, conditions did not stay the same; the climate became drier. As a result, forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands, the African savanna, with just a few scattered trees. The shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct.

Then, about 6 or 7 million years ago, one population of apes split, with some of them opting for life on that open savanna. All apes are capable of walking upright, they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time.  Recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them, walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking. Chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly.

That savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity. by about 4 mya, our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis, femur, knees and feet as modern humans. That gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel. They did however, retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened.

The apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change. They became the ancestors of today's chimps and bonobos. Those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes, and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them. It set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us.",3.0,0.0

Animal cell

Eukaryotic cells, with membrane ,organelles and nucleus containing DNA that calls the shots 
Animal, plants, fungi and protist
Flexible and squishy membranes as oppose to plants, allowing the creation of cell, organs and tissue types

Cell is like a city:

On the surface:

Microtubials: made of long protein fibers: Cillia (tiny arms like in lungs and throat pushing the mucus up) and Flagella (whip-like tail like in sperms), Protozoans, move with Microtubials instead of muscle tissue
Membrane: Selective permeability: monitoring coming in and out like boarders

Inside:

Cytoplasm: water+nutrients
Cytoskeleton: scaffolding made of protein strands, Centrosomes: infrastructures
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): network of membranes like a highway system 

The smoother parts of ER are like factories: 
containing enzymes (proteins) producing lipids, 
detoxifying substances by adding carboxyl to make them soluble in water, 
storing ions like Sodium used for energy

The rougher parts of ER have Ribosomes attached to them:
Synthesis and packaging of proteins

Ribosomes: float freely, assemble amino acids into Polypeptides pushing the protein chain into ER where it's bitten off and sent to Golgi Aparatus

Golgi: made of membranous layers: the post office for packaging proteins, cutting them into hormones, combining them with Carbs to make molecules
Vessicles: the packages with Phospholipid walls

Lysosome: waste treatment and recycling, sacks containing enzymes breaking down cell waste into building material 

Mitochondria: the power plant where respiration takes place, fuels converted to Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) which is the currency 
They were separate bacteria that animal cells absorbed and kept, and they still act as their own organisms with their own DNA, they exist in the egg and doesn't mix with sperms DNA during fertilization

Nucleus:

The leader
Contains DNA and has all the information and instructions

Has a double membrane
Nucleoplasm (is like Cytoplasm)
Nucleolus at the center: creates Ribosomal RNA+proteins=Ribosomes
Messenger RNA: carry the orders to Ribosomes

Chromatin: web-like substance that holds DNA molecules, upon cell division they gather into rod-shaped chromosome, humans have 46",1101.0,1.0

Video Two: Water
ÔÇß H2O uses a covalent bond: each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen. It is thus a polar molecule.
ÔÇß All water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity ‚Äì these are hydrogen bonds (between the positive and negative poles of different molecules)
ÔÇß Hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion, and thus high surface tension.
ÔÇß Cohesion is the attraction between two like things (e.g. two water molecules).
ÔÇß Water has the highest cohesion of any non-metallic liquid.
ÔÇß Adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things (e.g. water and glass).
ÔÇß Capillary action is water defying gravity.
ÔÇß Water is the greatest solvents (due to its polarity). 
ÔÇß Hydrophilic molecules are polar ‚Äì their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water.
ÔÇß Hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are non-polar.
ÔÇß Solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily (when frozen).

Another answer would be ‚Äúwe have no way of knowing.‚Äù People like to assign emotions to things, but a lot of the time those emotions are just self-reflection. 

People assign the wrong emotions to animals too, even though we know animals can feel emotion, people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly. This happens all the time. 

So even when we find out trees can experience emotion (and some evidence already suggests this) we would probably still force our own perspective onto them, like we do now.

What we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do, with the conditions they are given. Are they ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù being the tree that they are? I don‚Äôt think trees know this concept. I think people shouldn‚Äôt anthromorphise their idea of ‚Äúsucces and satisfaction‚Äù onto plants.

14192,1Xp_imnO6WE,The hardest part of that first trick is wrestling a cane away from an old lady at the park. They're deceptively strong.,523.0,1.0
14193,1Xp_imnO6WE,"My take... Probably messed some up...

1. The cane gets stabilized by the fact that the lighter side of the cane gets less friction form Your finger than the heavier side, so that finger moves faster towards the COM of the cane. This causes the effect to flip and the fingers slowly align themselves around the center of mass...
2. The phone is not evenly weighed, so spinning it in some axis would make it destabilize, right...? Well, the same effect is observed when spinning a brick (it fell on my foot... twice... while I tested that) that I played around with. I believe this effect occurs because of the fact that the center of mass of the brick/phone is in the middle of the whole object, so rotating it around the axis that allows more mass to rotate around further from the COM will work because the particles far away have to have less momentum, the spin is easier. On the other hand, spinning the phone the other way makes more particles have more energy, so this state is unstable. The phone starts to spin in a way that makes some of the particles decelerate, which is a more stable state (rhyme unintended). The same thing is observed when spinning around and then extending Your hands out, which causes You to decelerate.
3. This one is a bit of a troll... I tested deuterium water and distilled water... and the distilled one produced no (less) effect! It‚Äôs not the water that is attracted to the cup, it‚Äôs the stuff in it (ions)!!!
4. The cereal contains some iron, which is magnetic. This makes it attracted to the magnet... Maybe, but what is interesting is that water and glass, fex, are pushed away by magnets... it‚Äôs diamagnetic! Anyways... Maybe the magnet makes like a small cavity in the water that the cereal falls into? I did not observe one, I do not know, but I did manage to destroy a box of good cereal and throw the cereal all over the floor!
5. Hot air rises. As the hot air creates a rising bubble, the material the tea bag is made out of slowly burns away. When it gets light enough, it slowly flies up...

Hope I am correct. :)

If you use the second method, there‚Äôs two points of contact, and thus as long as the center of mass is in-between, it cannot tilt. You can try finding the center of mass on your own, with two fingers together, without using the special method, and just doing it normally, and you‚Äôll see it works fine.

Each of us sat on a high stool as a shotput suspended from the high ceiling by a cable was brought up to within an inch or two of our nose. He asked each of us, ""Do you know the laws of pendulum motion."" Our response was of course ""Yes."" Then just as he released the shotput he said, ""Know we will see if you believe them."" Most, but not all sat still as that eight pounds of lead rocketed back towards our noses. Only a few ducked away a the last second. That was 63 years ago. I remember it like it was yesterday.

I recommend it to you. And while you're at it, you might as well also look into his interpretation of quantum mechanics, called Bohmian mechanics, since you showed interest in quantum theory. His interpretation gets rid of the inconsistency/incompleteness from which the standard interpretation suffers in an elegant and easy to understand way, and in a way which takes all of the apparent ""magic"" out of the theory.

I was fascinated to see that Roger Penrose uses Godel incompleteness to support his views on the nature of consciousness, since I came to the same conclusions on my own years ago based on the same mathematics. So cool to hear my ideas coming from the mouth of such a brilliant man!",28.0,2.0

They create a downdraft with solid state electronics that is sufficient to propel them upwards.  They don't defy physics though, rather they rely on well-known physics.

14515,dHsxkaxRfnE,"Amazing video thank you! Yes, atomic motion is perpetual. Mass changing its position in space = motion. Perpetual? Well for most of us billions of years is long enough. So, examples of perpetual motions (does not factor in wear and tear of the device); solar panels, water mills, wind mills, geo thermal (Iceland), John Bedini generator which uses a drive battery that looses only a few milliamps while the charging battery gains hundreds of millivolts (I personally recharged hundreds of batteries, with carefully measured results)... The physics here at play is to not be stuck to one view, one device and what it does by itself. Yes that's being confined to thermodynamics. However, look outside the box for energy source (solar panels obtain their energy not from photovoltaic panels, but from the sun). Thermodynamics is true in CLOSED or ISOLATED systems. Nitinol is also overunity (which perpetual motion is a part of) using cold and hot water to activate it cyclically.  The most abundant phase of matter in the universe is plasma (an electrically charged - ionized gas). Well, a lot of energy could be pulled out of these stellar gas, and they will be energized until the end of time by stars. Are we introverted into a small device set in motion, or are we scientifically, logically looking at the big picture? As long as we stay stuck in a boxed-in frame of reference, we don't progress.

Of course, if you only have empirical evidence (i.e. it's been tested in the real world) your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof. So in that way, it might be that some problems CS folks tackle are ""scientific"" empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics.

14759,gI-qXk7XojA,"A good video as always! As a CS major myself, this is actually finally a series where I can answer questions and stuff in the comment section! Just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info:

1) There are also not versions of all the gates. AND, OR, and XOR become NAND, NOR, XNOR, respectively. They are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate. While they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs, they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts. You often here people verbally NAND and XNOR when talking about logic, so I think it is interesting to note even though this isn't computer engineering.

2) While by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false, this is often not the case when we actually look at real components. Because of power usage, the opposite is often used. Generally, the more common output is set to 0.

3) 0 doesn't actually mean nothing is flowing through. For example, we may set our 1 to 5 volts, and our 0 to 2.3 volts. This allows for us to have an ""off"" state at 0 volts. We wouldn't want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off! There are also other uses for this state, but this may be covered in a future video.",141.0,2.0

Then over the summer I was able to learn so many other languages, Swift, Python, JavaScript. I had all this growth in a little under a year. All I‚Äôm saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesn‚Äôt know how to code, and don‚Äôt think it will get easier. Trust me, it gets easier, do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like (it else‚Äôs, while for loops etc) to help you gain a feel of how they work. I would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java, as a beginner this is a daunting task for me. So over winter break I made projects such as, modeling a Car in java, okay what functions does a car have, accelerate, decelerate, break, etc. from then I could think of variables, okay what could toggle a car being on or off? Oh a boolean! Oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero, okay that‚Äôs loop there, with gas level modeled as an int. See things like this slowly helped my logic grow, and now I can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me. Trust me  I‚Äôm still a beginner as well, but I ended up catching up to the kids around me when I was once behind, and in times when you feel like giving up, please don‚Äôt, I urge you to stick through it because it does get easier.",646.0,2.0

14859,rL8X2mlNHPM,"I've always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we, as humans, seem to sort things; it seems like we're much more efficient than many of the algorithms (at least the ones I've seen, which is admittedly few). For example, when we look at all the items, we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once (e.g. ""oh, I remember that was the smallest before I found the actual smallest, so that's the second smallest. Let me put both of them first and second right now, saving myself a re-look""). I know computers are still faster in the end, but I suspect that's because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data (and possibly our brain has a slower ""clock speed""), rather than computational efficiency. Anyone know if that's true?

Has anyone made a ""human sort"" algorithm, so to speak, that sorts the way we do, including our little ""tricks""? (I'm guessing no). If not, are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two, like the one I just described?",7.0,2.0
14860,rL8X2mlNHPM,"Just a few things to note about the ""big-oh"" notation discussed in this episode:

In industry, ""big-oh"" notation alone is what is seen when discussing algorithms. However, in academia, it is a bit more in depth. O(n) is instead used to represent an upperbound (in the WORST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). Œ©(n) (pronounced ""big-omega"") is used to represent the lowerbound (in the BEST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). Œò(n), prounounced ""theta"" (without the ""big"") is used to represent the tightbound (used when the big-oh is equal to the big-omega, which is the exact running time). There is also small omega and small o, but those are rarely used.

Also, we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation. So if a problem takes 5n^4 + 3n^2 + 1 to do, we just say it is Œò(n^4). We drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big.

You may notice that earlier I mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation. This is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem. For example, for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix, we have Œ©(n^2), since we know that we at least need to read in n^2 values. This problem currently has O(n^2.3728639) which is the running time of an algorithm created by Francois Le Gall in 2014.",25.0,1.0

14914,z3o6yEzcnLc,"I did my undergrad in Computer Science and I'm finishing up my MS in Computer Engineering. It always drives me nuts when people ask what I do and then assume either is just ""programming"" or ""software engineering"". I try to explain it like this: Computer Science is centered around mathematics(computational science) and problem solving; developing algorithms and optimization. Programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems. Computer Engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems. I always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took Computer/Electrical Engineering as undergrads. Because they, generally speaking, are simply trying to make X thing work, and I am trying to make X thing run as efficient as possible. You can take several different paths to become a coder, but there's very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines. Anyone looking at going to school for Computer Science should understand this. You are learning to be a problem solver first, coding is secondary. Anyone can learn to code. But, being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career. If you go down this path, you are going to be doing far more math than coding, and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code. You will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts, libraries, and frameworks. But, those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use. I hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into.",284.0,0.0

Most of CS is a lot of abstract data structures and ideas that you may never even ever use, but knowing the pipeline of actually creating software and those different methodologies (Agile which is just old school RAD with more crap to have to deal with, Waterfall, Spiral, etc. etc.) will give you a better idea of what you'll be doing on the day to day.

after some years of experience I know by myself how difficult it can get when learning and optimizing programming skills. 
A few days ago I had a very interessting, nerdy conversation about this topic with a very good friend of mine who is also in the programming business for many years.
The question which fascinated me the most was "" how one could make the lives of programmer a lot easier?""
The reason why i tell you this is because I am very exited about your opinion on this topic!Especially the following 2 questions would interest me the most:
1. As programmer, what are/ were the 2 biggest issues you‚Äôre dealing with?
2. Regarding your programming skills, what would you wish for more than anything else?

Think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before, remembering a few equations like dates in history class, nor by just scrapping by. 
Office hours are the key to succeess, yes. But even more important than that, you MUST COMPLETE ALL HOMEWORK WHEN DUE, AND DONT EVER GIVE UP ON A SINGLE PROBLEM. THEN, YOU MUST PRACTICE, PRACTICE! 
Don‚Äôt study. Only practice. That way you don‚Äôt just know, you have complete UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CONCEPTS. Much like pointing out a particular color in the room, you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing (like identifying red + letters S T O P means ""stop!"") how to approach the problem and what equation, formula etc to use.

I know it ruins the game for some people (the Pok√©mon holding on has a higher rate of stopping KO than the focus band, apparently but don't quote me on that) but for me it was JUST want i wanted as a jaded almost-30 year old who really just wanted to enjoy the game.",11.0,2.0

New weapons, story mode that feels spatial, practically a free choice of character customization of much more!

I love the aggressive approach to the specials too reverting back to what splatoon offered. It gives people a chance who normally wouldn't be able to dominant due to lack of necessary skill or just going against weapons that absolutely oppress them. I personally play short ranged weapons and it gets tough to approach when you are constantly matched up with mid to long-ranged weapons when your weapon doesn't have the kit to contend.

What I think MS plans to do is make the console the foundation of their business strategy. They will have console exclusives, but they will not restrict their games to just the console device which is Sony's strategy. It just means they will release on multiple devices from PCs, to TV's, to mobile phones, and through cloud. MS has expanded agreesively.

Xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises. Halo, Gears of War, um...I'm sure I'm forgetting some others. The line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption.

15775,JzjkmhcpYYU,"I‚Äôm very happy with my Series S, and I‚Äôve been all about physical media before I got it. I do plan on getting a series X eventually, but I‚Äôve just been playing digital games on my Xbox One most of the time because of Game Pass Ultimate. After thinking about it, I realized my physical library on Xbone was substantially smaller than my PS4 library or Switch library, so I didn‚Äôt really feel bad about getting the Series S and an external hard drive. Even though my 360 library was pretty big, I‚Äôve been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like $3 each digitally. When the Series X becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper, I‚Äôll get one but for now I‚Äôm really enjoying my Series S",160.0,2.0
15776,JzjkmhcpYYU,As someone on a budget the series s is great game pass makes it really great especially with the deals u can get and just using external hard drives are a better option because transferring games is better than paying half the price of the console for the ssd so yeah if u have more money maybe get the series x but it just depends on ur situation,50.0,2.0
15777,JzjkmhcpYYU,"I have a decent amount of physical games from the original Xbox, 360, and one so I feel justified getting the Series X especially because it has superior fps at 4K resolution. The problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series X to its limits yet. If you still have a one X and plan to get a Series X later and can wait, you can update the Internal HDD to a SDD on the One X. It‚Äôll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the Series S. The One X has a better graphics card than the series S, previous games optimized for the One X will look better on the One X than on the series S. However cross platform games are probably going to have a better FPS than the X do to the better CPU. There‚Äôs a lot that goes into this stuff. 

Another factor to consider is the quality of your tv. I‚Äôll be looking to pair my Series X with a new OLED tv here soon and then I‚Äôm 200% sure I‚Äôll feel justified with the purchase.

Also I game a lot so 30, 60, 120 frames a second‚Ä¶ I notice the difference. And in no way shape or form would I feel justified having a next gen console (Series S) that can‚Äôt even keep up with my old 4K tv.",44.0,2.0

15781,JzjkmhcpYYU,"I don't have a Series X yet, and although Series S is a great console, the fact is all digital is a no go for me. The reason is that I have a good collection of XBOX 360 and XBOX One physical games, and some of them, such as older Forza Horizon or Forza Motorsport games are not available to buy digitally anymore due to  license issues. So the only way of playing those games is using the disc. I would be happy with a Series So with disc drive, but as this is not an option, I'll have to go with the Series X.
Another point is that, although GamePass is great (I had it for two years and experienced great games, including Halo Infinite), I think it is a bit too expensive. If it was $80 per year, as the Live Gold was, it would be a no brainer, but at $15 per month ($180 per year) I think it is too expensive.

BUT,  I didn't want to completely move away from gaming and I managed to find an absolute awesome deal on a Series S.  140 euros with 2 controllers and 1 of those controllers is the 20th anniversary edition.

If you don't mind moving games. I'd suggest getting an ultra small flashdrive (like the Sandisk Ultra Fit). You can easily fit 2 on the back USB ports on the Xbox giving up to 1TB of more storage. While still having room the expandable SDD too. Plus you can play the older Xbox One games off the flashdrive.

Obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console. But for Sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially BRIBE multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay FULL price on there platform instead, because they know they can't compete with it, is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get.

15932,6lbJ55D7rKg,"IMO what's most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly they're hoping to get out of these deals. Everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership, and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money. But then what I have to wonder is if Gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios, then why wouldn't they turn down PS? In theory, Gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties. We've also seen plenty of evidence that Xbox is swimming in Microsoft money, so they should easily have the means to outbid Sony for games they want on their service (as well as typical console exclusives for that matter). Yet, we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to Sony's deals and stipulations. If a studio wanted to join GP and told Sony they would decline their GP restriction contract, I can see them getting less marketing on PS but I highly doubt Sony wouldn't want their sales. Cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with Sony, but I don't know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line. It just seems to me like somehow many studios aren't jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on Gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it. That or GP isn't as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think. (No shade at GP, I love it, just saying I don't get how MS would be losing out to Sony's contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place)",12.0,2.0

I have one of the series 1 pro controllers (which I bought used) and frankly I was disappointed that after I had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel. I had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there, because Xbox doesn't offer their own replacement parts, which I find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue. To be honest I would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isn't going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time. The paddles are nice and all, but I can buy like 3 games for the cost or I can buy a third party controller from S.C.R.U.B. for less and get the same functionality out of it. But hey, to each their own. What I would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab. I would pay extra for that, but as it stands right now, I'll stick with my standard series X controller ü§∑",0.0,0.0

Maybe they had plans to do this originally with Certain Affinity? (as its been confirmed that massive support studio was working with the Initiative from the earliest days... most likely on a prototype)

But it looks like Gallagher went with his old studio, Crystal Dynamics and this was the final straw that caused the schism with a number of the earlier Initiative hires. But is it really that surprising? The Initiative wasn't hiring hundreds of devs every year to scale up for a massive AAA project... they were hiring like a dozen employees per year instead. And even Jeff Grubb once succinctly put it, 'Perfect Dark was never going to be made by the Initiative'.

Pretty sure Gallagher and other high-ups knew, if they were going to make an AAA game, they were always going to need a large & experienced studio to take on most of the work-load. Trying to get that done with a 65-75 person team isn't realistic.",15.0,1.0

but i also remember microsoft being at first very oppositional to the idea of the ""free to repair"" thing, but shortly after that they were called in again and microsoft had completely reversed their decision, so if a third party repairservice was able to repair anything to my series 1 controller as its been a while since i bought it, id be all in favor of it!! that would just secure the longevity of any controller basically for the foreseeable future and im glad microsoft and xbox is supporting that !",0.0,1.0

I mean seriously, you are telling me your representation of Chinese is representing all the world's Chinese? That is patronizing as hell, because I can tell you there are so many differences between American Chinese, China Chinese and other Chinese living in different parts of the world. Crazy Rich Asians just made me cringe so hard, yes I am from Singapore.

I believe No Way Home would be the last good MCU movie for a long time ever, if not forever. Tried to watch Dr Strange 2, but felt like they killed the original Dr Strange and replaced him with a fake.

If you want a good representation movie in recent times. Try Everything Everywhere All At Once. Great representative movie, not because they checked the boxes but their background is actually part of the story, showing the struggles the characters experienced due to their background, plus the conflict between their cultural background and their current life . I mean they even represented rocks, who else can top it?",137.0,0.0

1:10 - Panel starts with a Sizzle reel narrated by Stan Lee. ""Marvel has always been and always will be a reflection of the world right side our window."" Footage from previous films plays: The Avengers, Infinity War, Black Panther... ""Today is our time."" Phase 4 titles start to be included. ""Welcome home,"" declares Vision. All three Spider-Man land together. Disney+ shows cut by with new heroes being included. It culminates with Clea opening a portal, Professor X, Thor landing, Matt Murdock catching a brick, Kingpin, more shots from Phase 4 movies and shows. The Illuminati, the Eternals, and more. Right at the end Miss Minutes jump scares the crowd.


10:40 - *Official Trailer | She-Hulk: Attorney at Law | Disney+ (YouTube)*


13:43 - *Secret Invasion* footage begins with a shot of a field as a beam of light opens along the horizon and a silhouetted figure resembling a classic grey alien emerges. As the figure gets closer, it takes on a less and less abstract shape until we see it is in fact Nick Fury, looking pretty grizzled after his time in space. Maria Hill meets with Fury at a bar. She tells him that she‚Äôs been unsuccessfully trying to reach him for years. Maria asks why after all this time he decided to come back. ‚ÄúThis is different,‚Äù he says. 

In a montage, we get quick glimpses of Talos encountering a group of evil Skulls, Emilia Clarke shooting a gun, Kingsley Ben-Adir multiplying into several identical forms in a confrontation with Fury, and Olivia Colman talking to Nick Fury saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in no shape for this Fury.‚Äù We also see Rhodey being questioned about his security detail and a shot of Martin Freeman as Agent Everett K. Ross. The trailer ends with Talos asking what the Skulls want from Nick Fury and Fury declaring, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the last person standing between them and what they really want.‚Äù


19:18 - *Ant-Man: Quantumania* footage opens at City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco, where Scott Lang is reading an excerpt from his new memoir, titled Look Out For The Little Guy, to an enraptured crowd, including a beaming little kid dressed in Ant-Man cosplay. He explains that he is still on call if the Avengers need him, but that his main priority in life is taking care of his daughter, Cassie. As he finishes the chapter and the crowd applauds, Scott‚Äôs phone rings, and the caller ID tells him that it‚Äôs the SFPD, leading him to remark aloud, ‚ÄúWhy is jail calling?‚Äù

After Scott bails his daughter, Cassie Lang, out of jail, they are seen eating dinner with the Pym/van Dyne‚Äôs (Hope, Hank, and Janet). Scott explains that he knows she is just trying to help, and when Cassie says that she is trying to ‚Äúdo something that matters,‚Äù her dad reminds her that he ‚Äúliterally saved the world.‚Äù This comment receives fake shock from everyone else, who sarcastically note that he has never mentioned that fact before, and Janet tells him that he should write a book about it. Shrugging it off, the Avenger retorts, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all welcome for all not being dust.‚Äù

Voice over narration from Kang The Conqueror begins, ""You're an interesting man Scott Lang. You've lost a lot of time. But time isn't what you think. It's not a straight line."" This dialogue is played as the heroes stand in a lab around some kind of device, which unexpectedly turns on. As it powers up, it emits a bright blue light that sends out an energy wave, and Cassie gets sucked inside of it. As Scott Lang panics and tries to grab her, he too is pulled inside the light along with the rest of the main cast, landing them in the Quantum Realm. 

In montage footage, The characters wander through a trippy sci-fi landscape where they run into Bill Murray, who is wearing a kind of fantasy robe. He seems to recognize Janet van Dyne. We also get a glimpse of MODOK. Kang‚Äôs voiceover continues, explaining that he knows how everything in Scott‚Äôs life ends. Scott responds, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who you are, but you‚Äôve made a big mistake. I‚Äôm an Avenger.‚Äù  The footage ends with Kang stepping out of the shadows, ""You're an Avenger? Have I killed you before?""


23:31 - *Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3* footage begins with Nebula piloting the ship as it is captured by Ravagers. She tells them to stand down as they have an appointment with Gamora, who is now leader of the Ravagers. Gamora appears, wearing all black and looking super tough. There's a shot of Peter Quill on his ship, looking sad. Peter reflects back on their time together. ""You were everything to me,"" he said. ""I thought you were gone but you're here and I miss you."" Gamora tells him that person was not her. 

In a montage set to ""Do You Realize"" by Flaming Lips, we see the Guardians in colorful spacesuits, leaping into space, the evil monster from the beginning of the last film, Peter and the team getting off in what looks like an Earth neighborhood. Nebula is helping to put up a sign in what appears to be a business district with alien writing. There's a flashback to a baby version of Rocket Raccoon. We get a look at Will Poulter's Adam Warlock, who has gold skin, Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary, and Cosmo the psychic Russian space dog, played by Borat‚Äôs Maria Bakalova. Groot fights back to back with Quill, now fully grown and even more bulky, muscular, and tall than in the original film. There is a shot of the team in their classic blue uniforms with red trimming from the comics. 

The Guardians are bounding across an alien planet. They‚Äôre each wearing brightly colored suits, each one different: blue, green, red, orange and yellow. Peter tries to talk to Gamora about their past. He asks if she might be willing to open herself up and she says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, Quinn.‚Äù Peter corrects her ‚ÄúQuill. It‚Äôs Quill.‚Äù At which point Mantis tells Peter that they‚Äôre on an open channel and everyone can hear.  

The footage ends with the Guardians all walking in slow motion, Groot, thicker and more muscular, no Rocket, and Gamora slightly off in the background.

16552,MCl7YGCTC6A,"You hit a soft spot with Ronin.  I think that movie is a masterpiece that went largely unnoticed.  The acting, the dense sub-text, the camera angles, the story progresses while revealing nothing.

Awesome",9.0,2.0
16553,MCl7YGCTC6A,"Penelope is actually a really great movie. My roommate and I love this movie and have watched it many many times. If you haven't seen it you should and I have to say it's a great movie for school age kids to watch because it will teach them a lot of lessons against bullying others, or if you're child is the one being bullied then they will learn a lot about how to love themselves no matter what they look like. And for those parents who criticize your children a lot you can learn a lot about accepting your child for who they are regardless of how you had envisioned your child to be. There's a lot to learn from people of all ages. Watch it!!",3.0,2.0
16554,MCl7YGCTC6A,"Great recommendations list, Darren. Ronin and the car chases, awesome and has a great plot. Silence Of The Lambs; just a superb horror. Agree that Anthony Hopkins is on his finest day, with his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. Just received my latest Universal Yums, from Czech Republic, today 9/23/2021!!! Many thanks for sharing with us and catch you on your next presentation. Take care ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",8.0,2.0
16555,MCl7YGCTC6A,"These movie reviews are always good, and largely because they are honest. If a given film is admittedly not the greatest or otherwise flawed,  the reviewer still tries  to point out what might be good or desirable about the movie etc. It's a very democratic approach. Always a good job !",1.0,2.0
16556,MCl7YGCTC6A,"I recently watched ""Hackers"" again and realized that it's a really good pairing with the original ""Tron"". They both present ridiculous representations of how computers work but they are complementary, just from opposite sides of the screen. Great performances from a great cast in both cases. They are solid presentations of how people wished computers worked in the late twentieth century immediately before and after Al Gore opened up the internet to everyone.",0.0,2.0
16557,MCl7YGCTC6A,"One thing that makes or breaks a film is how the filmmaker respects the source material, in this case being The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. The film respected and captured this incredible book, & the casting of Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins, with Jonathan Demme directing, made it a masterpiece. Some movies you sit and watch.  Others creat a dimensional world you enter completely and that never really leaves you.",2.0,2.0
16558,MCl7YGCTC6A,"While I generally agree with your comments about Ronin, the callous disregard of collateral damage - shooting into crowds and causing violent vehicle accidents - was a total turn-off for me. They spread injury and death among innocent bystanders without any sign of care or compassion.",3.0,0.0
16559,MCl7YGCTC6A,"I just watched Post Mortem on Netflix last night and really liked it.  It's from Norway and has only six episodes in the series.  I'm not sure how I could describe it - horror? (a little); comedy? (a bit); police procedural?  (I guess...some).  It was just really strange and (at least to me), very entertaining.  Also, I watch all foreign movies with sub-titles so I don't know if it's dubbed or not.  Anyway, check it out!",8.0,2.0
16560,MCl7YGCTC6A,"I'm sure you've seen Malevolent from 2018 with Florence Pogue, but if you haven't it's just a really well acted horror flick.  I seem to like just about everything Florence Pogue is in.  Thanks for another great list as I plan to check out Primer and Troll 2, both of which I never would have considered without your recommendation.  Pls keep making as many of these lists as you can!!",2.0,2.0

Kenji Lopez-Alt, Marion's Kitchen, Nicki Positano, and a few others are what got me through the days (weeks!) of quarantining alone and food shortages. The fridge in your old kitchen gave me hope that I  could shop and cook for good food and make it work in my ancient undersized fridge. At the same time, I was unemployed just before the pandemic.

16580,9k1dVfkF5gk,"Thank you so much Alison for sharing with us another of your wonderful recipes, even if they are as classic as a chicken piccata, I really appreciate the personal twists that you give to them! Your twists bring the dishes to a next level! ¬†

I am very sorry for the abuses (micro-aggressions) that you had to endure in your profession. I had no idea what the word ""Chef"", said it in that context, meant. But I know, from my own experience, how even simple words/statements can actually be aggressions towards other people. I have felt that many times in my profession too (which has nothing to do with cooking, btw!).

Lucky us that despite those unfortunate abuses, they did not make you dislike cooking and quit altogether. On the contrary, you persevered in your chosen path and now you are sharing your uniqueness and talent with us. Thanks again.

16651,HFah22ClwMg,"The film is set in Jennings County, Indiana, in 1862. Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper) is a farmer and patriarch of the Birdwell family whose Quaker religion conflicts with his love for the worldly enjoyments of music and horse racing. Jess's wife Eliza, (Dorothy McGuire) a Quaker minister, is deeply religious and steadfast in her refusal to engage in violence. Jess's daughter Mattie (Phyllis Love) wants to remain a Quaker but has fallen in love with dashing cavalry officer Gard Jordan (Peter Mark Richman), a love that is against her mother's wishes. Jess's youngest child ""Little"" Jess (Richard Eyer) is a feisty child whose comical feud with his mother's pet goose causes her heartache. Jess's elder son Josh (Anthony Perkins) is torn between his hatred of violence and a conviction that to protect his family he must join the home guard and fight the invaders. Enoch (Joel Fluellen), a runaway slave, is a laborer on their farm; his children are still enslaved in the South.

We are introduced to the family via its youngest member, ""Little"" Jess, who is forever at war with his mother's pet goose. The story begins as an easygoing and humorous tale of Quakers trying to maintain their faith as they go to meeting on First Day (Sunday); contrasted with the Birdwells' neighbor Sam Jordan (Robert Middleton) and other members of the nearby Methodist Church. The mood shifts dramatically when the meeting is interrupted by a Union officer who asks how the Quaker men can stand by when their houses will be looted and their families terrorized by approaching Confederate troops. When confronted with the question of his being afraid to fight, Josh Birdwell responds that it might be the case. His honesty provokes the wrath of Purdy, a Quaker elder who condemns people who don't believe as he does.

The film returns to its lighter tone as the Quakers try to maintain their ways, despite the temptations of amusements at a county fair, and a new organ (which Jess buys over Eliza's opposition), but one is always reminded that the Confederate Army is drawing closer. On a business trip, Jess acquires a new horse from the widow Hudspeth (Marjorie Main), and is finally able to defeat Sam in their weekly horse race. One day, Jess is cultivating his fields and notices an immense cloud of smoke on the horizon produced by the burning of buildings. Josh soon arrives and tells them the neighboring community has been reduced to ash and corpses. Josh believes that he must fight, a conviction that threatens to destroy the family. Eliza tells him that by turning his back to their religion he's turning his back on her, but Jess sees things a different way. Josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders, and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded. Meanwhile, Jess is reluctant to fight, only picking up a rifle and riding off towards the fighting when the family horse gallops back to the farm riderless.

When Confederates arrive at the farm, with only Eliza and the younger children present, the family and the farm are saved when Eliza greets them on the porch and welcomes them to take all the food and animals they want and feeds them in their kitchen. As Jess finds Sam Jordan dying he is bushwhacked by a ""Reb"". He plays possum and when the Confederate soldier approaches he struggles with him and takes away his gun, but ultimately lets him go free and unhurt. He then finds Josh injured and brings him home. Each member of the family faces the question of whether it is ever right to engage in violence.",33.0,1.0

16760,aJ2I8fvo-Zw,"Better Luck Tomorrow is still one of my all time favorite films. As an Asian-American, I never understood the criticism that this film made us look bad. That viewpoint was actually way worse and even racist, in my opinion. What, we can only have roles as nerds, straight A students, martial artists, dutiful sons and daughters, etc? This film portrayed more of my reality at that age than any other film ever did. Sure, I wasn't dealing and stealing and whatnot. I was in all advanced classes and band. But I also ran track and played volleyball and had a cheerleader girlfriend and went to parties. I felt seen by this film.

Even highly educated Proffesionals (CA's, Engineers, Doctors, Civil Servants etc) do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service. 

A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money.

Because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time . Hrithik Roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work .

As an established data scientist myself, this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle; however, I almost never go through all of these steps in the same day. You can spend whole days just cleaning data, tuning models, or putting things into production.

16927,X3paOmcrTjQ,"Great video. You did great explaining this. That said, I would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps. Specifically data acquisition and cleaning. Mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research. Furthermore, it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found. Do some field work, say NSF or an FFRDC gives you 2 million dollars for it. Go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don‚Äôt figure out until your back? Oh well. This seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies. All the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now? Now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned!

Plus they include big data streamlines and ask you to be an expert on it too along with all sorts of cloud services. I mean it feels like they're demanding an Intermediate Data Scientist and terming it as ""Data Analysis Intern"" or ""Junior Data Analyst"" role. This frustrates me a lot.",195.0,0.0
17006,pn0PUY0jwGQ,"Yes there‚Äôs ambiguity in role definitions. In my previous company, I worked as Data scientist. However I hardly did any data science work. It was more like a developer work where I was assigned to test and deploy the ML models in production. I could learn a lot about aws cloud architecture and services. Trouble shoot real time issues. But did little of ML. Then I changed my job and joined as Data analyst. Here I do little of analysis, SQL etc and more of ML like developing models and fine tuning them. Cleaning the data, feature engineering and feature selection. 
I would caution the people aspiring to enter the field because many a times companies themselves are not sure where and how they are going to use data science, what are the prerequisites for a successful data science project. They lack quality data, if they do have data- accessing and compiling the data is another issue. After aligning with multiple departments as single man army, you are expected to give some magical results. When results are satisfactory, you will be asked to deploy them. Here again the streamlined organisational requirements are missing. Somehow you drag the project. Later you are expected to monitor and troubleshoot issues in production. And then after all of this single man army efforts, management doesn‚Äôt see any value in it.

17009,pn0PUY0jwGQ,"thanks for sharing your experiences! The manager who spoke of wanted applied scientists (a category I wasn't aware of before this video) was odd to me.

I can imagine companies having this need (smaller companies in particular where individuals have to wear multiple hats), but if I were a data scientist trying to get hired as a data scientist, I'd avoid this manager/company! I actually left a job in the 90s for this reason--I was being pulled into other jobs/tasks that weren't related to machine learning, so I left and joined a company I could do machine learning full time (I'm an old guy!  I predated data science, so in that time, it was called ""data mining"" or ""pattern recognition"". and yes, I'm using machine learning and data science interchangeably even though I know they aren't fully interchangeable).

On the job, a lot of my peers find that they aren't challenged enough by their positions. This is probably because data science is still relatively new, and companies are still figuring out how to create value with data teams.

17029,O9nf1CqjGzI,"Thanks for the great content Shane. As a data scientist myself, who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially, given that my own engineering field had few jobs available, one thing I have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route. If you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline, plus the skills you need as a data scientist, you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot. While traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take, it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth. You end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do, but without the specialized domain knowledge. Coming from an engineering discipline myself, I was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways. I have noticed the same with my other peers who also don't come from the traditional route. I say this because I have met with a lot of non-traditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they can't break through. They definitely can break through and thrive in this field. They offer specialized insights you can't get through the traditional route. So if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities, like linguistics or english, you can become a powerful data scientist (with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied, such as NLP). If you are someone who comes from a STEM field, even better, because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems. All data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science. But what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem, address user needs, and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model. I don't mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off, but I do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well.",24.0,2.0

There's so many new data science and analytics Master's programs that have opened up, along with the wide variety of analytical degrees that are acceptable (statistics, computer science, economics, physics, etc) that someone without an analytical degree and without any job experience as a data analyst or other data professional is just never going to get an interview.

17074,rqvyWUODZGE,"I agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time I think there's a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about: democratization and the experience catch 22. 

I feel like your video alluded to what I mean by democratization quite well so I think we're probably in agreement there. A lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow, pytorch, and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models. I think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boiler-plate enough that it's ripe for ""automation"" using some kind of auto-ml, the sql-like syntax that redshift and BigQuery offer, or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away. This opens ML models up to the tech-savy but non-specialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already, pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and ML-OPs. We still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often it's just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day.

For experience I really think there's a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless self-teaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people. This is where I think we disagree: the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you don't talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience. The largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you. I would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level. My expectation is that you'd see a massive gap favoring employers at 0-2 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5+ years of experience. So while the industry is expanding, the companies aren't hiring juniors, or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program.

Together I think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals. If workers with domain experience (but not a DS education) can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job I think we're going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry. Perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree",117.0,2.0
17075,rqvyWUODZGE,"Personally I think you hit one key point: the importance of domain experts.  With the so-called automation or new technology/ tools we'll likely see a shift to empower the domain experts and focus more on the business needs.  Just because someones knows SQL or do coding doesn't mean he/she can do data science or machine learning -- or more importantly, to put out anything meaningful or even useful.  Just like years ago people needed to rely heavily on someone who can do graphic design really well or who can use a handful of high-skill tools (say photoshop) really well to even modify a picture or video.  These days even kids can snap a picture or video and publish to Instagram or Tiktok.  Did the modern photo editing tools make graphic designer extinct? No.  But it does mean that you need to be REALLY GOOD to be able to survive as a graphic designer.  I see the same future for data science field too.  Maybe not tomorrow, but the trend is coming for sure.

Once that is done, usually the process is just data cleaning and then running the libraries you decided on already which is fairly trivial (though potentially data cleaning is time consuming).

Also despite having a higher barrier to entry the outlook for data science jobs is worse than that of software engineering because the demand is a lot less compared to software engineering.

Working as a ML engineer you spend way more time reviewing and maintaining code (so it's more SE from one side), you use python for model development and c++/java for production (the role is building AI products, so you are all day reviewing, extracting and preprocessing data to then training ML models, evaluate them and match required KPIs)

In the other hand, data scientists positions offer what is described in the video: statistics and data preparation (engineering) and classic ML, there is more flexibility regarding tools and programming languages, and the final purpose is bringing value in a business perspective with the projects you have

For example, In ML engineering you get assigned some set of models that you have to maintain and improve, in data scientist positions you get several projects that constantly change. Both roles have their advantages and interesting scopes

As I am nearing the end of my journey I have realized that the path in computer science ( DS/DA) is not structured like one probably imagined it would be. What I am wondering is if you encountered the same during your journey in terms of learning these program tools (Python, SQL, tableau, R,) if what‚Äôs important while in school is getting a basic understanding of these tools and how to use them,  but the real challenge starts after graduating, in teaching yourself on how to use these tools more effectively to actually be able to draw meaningful insights ?

Did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs? I have beginner level on all these programs right now but I feel like I probably won‚Äôt be able to land a job in data analytics until I‚Äôm at least intermediate in SQL and at least Python, for starters.

And the task is formalized in a way, that next() and hasNext() methods should be enough to do the flattening (which is again more difficult).

The fascination with data science dies down once the projects are not relevant to your field of interest/domain of expertise. Moreover, companies now have a hard time justifying the massive amount of investment done towards data science.

1) Study the various roles in data science by researching and asking people and figure out what is best for you.
2) After you a role, study the JD for that role in various companies & check what is needed in order for you to qualify for that role.
3) Go on linkedin and study the profiles of people who are already in that role.
4) The coding is not necessarily the first thing that you need to learn.  Studying the theoretical/ conceptual part first is suggested.
5) After the concepts are clear now learn coding and try to work on data
6) Work on a project ( Kaggle is a great place to start)

My data science journey started last year during the pandemic when I was locked out of my PhD lab and needed to do something productive.
My process so far
1. Data Science in R series from Harvard on Edx
2. Reading practical statistics for data science with a bookclub
3. Python programming course
Pre4. Learned some linear algebra, calculus 
4a. ML course
4b. Data science fellowship with DS4A
Now. Learning SQL online!
Always. Engage in DS community and attend talks to learn about various topics
Next. Applied Machine learning class to do some project work and also I should  finish my PhD this semester!!",11.0,2.0

The marketing thing was something I never considered, so it's going to be a focus with my next game.  I made a game, and this video was so incredibly accurate to my journey, learning how much work everything is and my scope was too big in places, and that I naively expected Steam to give me enough visibility to get the game out there.

If there's something to add, every discipline has it own depths on knowledge, perfecting stuff like design pattern, design principle, code conventions, CI/CD pipeline, Automate Test, etc. (for programmers) is needed when your project grow. That come along as other department.
Maybe at the first time you think you won't need dedicated Project Manager that handling all daily task and scrum, but when project get larger, team gets bigger, you will need that one and for indie who grow to bigger company usually overwhelmed with this kind of situation. Heck, if you love making games later on you won't even touch the project as too many things on managerial you will handle on. 

If you just started game dev, make sure that one day what you want to become is pretty clear, will you create your own studio? or work for big companies? which discipline? what studio ? (this can be matter as a programmer / artist who need align their technology / artstyle).

17441,naES42NxbyY,"It's two different things; to start learning and to make your first serious game. When you start learning, if you go straight away to make your ""dream game"", it will likely be frustrating, because you have a vision of the game in your head but you can barely translate any of that vision into an actual game. Creating a copy or a ""remake"" of an already existing game that you like is a good way to learn. When I started learning Unity, some years ago, after doing a few tutorials I decided I would create a ""remake"" of Duke Nukem 3D, using some of the assets of Duke Nukem Forever and remaking the first level of the game in Blender, this was so that I could focus mainly on the coding side of things and put the creative part of it aside for the project. It took me, I believe, 6 months to finish it, it had all the basic game mechanics and the first level of the game, and yes, it played terrible and nothing like the original. But the amount of learning I did thanks to this learning project was really a lot, I don't think I could have learned faster other way. Another point I would mention is: learning to code: I think was the most important thing I did.

I realized I didn't actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games (that's why ethical monetization is my specialty now). So for sure, there's data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions. It also encompasses monetization and systems design - though I wasn't formally trained in monetization design before joining (it's actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first). Monetization design encompasses things like battle passes, loot box designs, game ecoystem design (hard currency to soft currency, what resources are tradable and purchasable, etc.), designing events and seasons (what content should be available, how is it distributed, what does progression and rewards look like in an event, etc.) and ofc the pricing of it all. We also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones. We often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction, purchase regret, MAU, revivals, etc to get a sense of this. 

My role today though focuses on a broader list of things, not just monetization but particularly engagement and retention as well! I made a video about what the responsibilities are so feel free to check that out :)",77.0,2.0

-I totally got the eureka moments in every level
-It will be easier to automatically grab de magnet
-I got softlocked many times so the restart was nice. I dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset
-Initially I thought I should return to the key hub, that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic
-I'll love to move while aiming, it feels more fluent
 -The key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but I don't know how well it fits in the game. The doors weren't like the key type so it doesn't make sense to open them with it, also it's kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe... maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better
-Maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character, for example making the positive smile and the negative sad

17515,iAxSqi5LBDM,"As a game developer I have always taken the ""boring stuff"" incredibly seriously. If you want to maximize efficiency when developing your game, you have to work on your framework before you even try working on the entire game's campaign or whatever else. In fact - and I discovered this the same way you did, Mark - by building that framework, often times you will accidentally end up building an MVP or demo at the same time.

I did this as well. I'm still working on my first game, but just recently, I started closing in on the final lines of code for my Unreal Engine 5 framework that I will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off (as in, when I'm not the only employee). Well, I'm working on my framework, and I look at the level I've built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added, and I realized, I basically just built a pre-alpha demo for my game; all I need is to make the level actually look good (because my level design skills are awful) and I basically now have a pre-alpha project. It's funny how that can happen sometimes.

Either way, I always take this stuff seriously. Frameworks are everything in my opinion - having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier, since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it.",136.0,1.0

17562,66SKA06jouw,"1:03:08 since we are talking about mines I wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines.

Now I understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines (which I love because they leave a large impact on the world!) But it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often.

That is why I thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future.

There could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts (or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is FAR later into development.) You could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts.

The way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks.

A MAJOR issue with this though is how the camera system would work... I could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however I feel like that might not fit the game. (I wouldn't have an issue with it but others may.)

Of course you can always do your standard 1st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldn't work when trying to make mineshafts I think.

Edit: I guess maybe you could still do your 1st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground.

Another thing I thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground... I say that as if it is easy when I actually know hardly anything about game development but I do believe that should be achievable.

But going far underground would allow you to find metals that you normally wouldn't which I think would be cool... Of course it would probably be behind some kind of research that would allow you to brace your tunnels or something to prevent collapse.",7.0,1.0

17624,286SGzpUx9o,"Imo something that's Extremely underrated, especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on. Observer pattern is a MUST for game dev with larger projects. Having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects, and it makes your code more modular (each class/game object is its own self contained thing). Singleton and Factory patterns, as well as SOLID principles are also good to look into. Factory less so for Unity since you can use GetComponent to retrieve references for things.

those options are:
- player has 200 health points

- health and power pickups
- airborne / aerial targets (such as drones, heavy gunner drones, scout drones, etc.)
- ground targets (such as beam-shooting mechs, enemy balls (similar to the player but a little bit dumb), and laser artilleries.)
- the tank can destroy the turret (since the tank has the same weapons as the turret, but it has significantly high damage on every shot from the tank.)
- grenade-type weapons and projectiles (i meant by that which has new weapons to choose, such as full-auto grenade launcher with a very low rate of fire, or just a single-shot grenade launcher, similar to the M79.)
- the shield can spawn by using a shield powerup :)

17756,1mwNrMD0Lm0,"yo, this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was, so I feel like I should clear a few things up.

First off, to game devs who are just starting out: don't attempt to do exactly what I did, because it probably won't work out well. And I'm not saying this because I think I'm smarter or better at game dev than you. In all honesty, I'm pretty average and tons of people could've done a lot better in my shoes. But that's just the thing, not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that I had. Prior to this I'd been making 2D games and was quite familiar with coding, so carrying that over to Unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple. I mentioned this in the video, but I've seen too many comments in the vein of ""wow this was impressive, I would never be able to do this"" which frankly makes me feel a little bad, since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience I had and I don't want to discourage anyone who doesn't realize this. 

So I just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2D games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions. Also, everyone learns at their own pace in their own way, and the rate at which that gets done doesn't really matter as long as you're able to learn what you needed to learn in the end (within reason of course, if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print ""hello world"", then we might have a problem). So even if you have as much experience as I did, there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time. Because ultimately, it doesn't really matter how quickly you're able to learn how to make games. As a game developer, you develop games, and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about, not how quickly you can make them. Of course, this mostly only applies if you're doing this as a hobby, and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay, you should probably worry a little more.

And on the other side of the spectrum, to those who think this video was faked: it wasn't lol. As mentioned before, I already knew how to make 2D games and how to program things, arguably the hardest part of developing games. Because of that, the focus of this video wasn't on that but rather applying what I knew to 3D games by learning 3D modelling, animation, and how to work with Unity, which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such. But mostly this was just for shits and giggles since I find messing around with 3D games entertaining, and I feel like people may be reading into it too much lol. Also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar, but that was caused by how I usually record clips while video editing, and not when I'm actually making the games. So I just have a weird workflow.

And last thing, to YouTube: why the fuck does this have 500,000 views. did the algorithm break? I can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500,000 views, and this is definitely not one of them. so if you're watching this, go watch someone else's video or something, this one has way too many views already.",1197.0,0.0

AAA game companies are trying too hard to make the 'biggest game'. Big being, best graphics, biggest worlds, widest variety be in customization, weapons, vehicles etc. Which will need lots of people and technology naturally. Which i could excuse that for big game companies withholding new projects.

Except when you have games like Undertale, Minecraft (before Microsofts purchase) Goosegame, Goat Simulator, powerwash simulator, etc. Getting loads and loads of sales when they're developed by small teams. These games are very basic graphically, have a very short play time (minecraft an exception), no big budget, no fancy effects, no extraordinary acting. But just simple fun

Heck, id be willing to consider Undertale a masterpiece, and it's a very short game.

I was unlucky that in my college years, you generally only had 1 option in IT. Which were basically programming for databases and networking. While I specifically went to learn coding and (graphics) designing to create games. I learned the graphics part on my own, also because I had a real knack and passion for it. Coding was more difficult, as information to code for gaming or even a game-engine, were hard to come by (or expensive).
Now, almost 2 decades further, our country finally is getting a gaming-industry and there are classes you can follow. I hope I can start in September and hopefully they're not too basic, as I already have some basics.
I already tried creating a game twice, sort of. First time was more than a decade ago, supposed to be a fighting game or beat'em up. I got my character modelled (not textured) and even rigged for facial animation. But I soon realized that coding and balancing a fighting game is really hard to do. So much to consider and take into account. And there wasn't even a decent free engine that could provide what I needed.
Two years ago, I started again, but with another genre I liked and more manageable (for a single game dev),  an arcade racer. Luckily I was able to pick up Blender easily where I left of (they also made it more user-friendly). And found a decent free game-engine: Godot. Atleast good enough to give me the taste of game-creation and create a tiny concept. I have some videos on my game-dev channel: 'Close Call Racing'on channel 'eyeEmotion'.
I have been on a break from it because of renovations at home, which I have to execute myself. And I'm changing to Unreal Engine, since its change in licensing and it's more friendly to devs who are more into designing than programming.

17893,RTpj9_S4zVU,This looks awesome man! I love your idea of being able to make your base mobile and fly. Your terrain designs and creatures are also very cool. Keep up the good work and thanks for the video!,2.0,2.0
17894,RTpj9_S4zVU,"The progress is looking super awesome and impressive! Also spending 3 years behind a single project shows dedication. Really like the features that you showed here especially where the one where the base starts flying. For the enemies A, B and C I actually like all of them. You could use all three and give different functionality to them like one of them are predator and hunts the other two and the player.

@0:45 you could use blender's ""Merge By Distance"" to merge the vertex. I just enable this by default and give the lowest distance value and blender just merges vertex automatically if they are too close like in your one. Saves lot of time.

Keep it up! :)",2.0,2.0
17895,RTpj9_S4zVU,the game looks great i love the models also the video editing skills are great :D i wish i could make even one 3d model lol x''; i subscribed!!,1.0,2.0
17896,ueNhxQ2lYOM,It's really bold of you to ditch the safety of your master's degree to pursue your indie dev career. Truly inspiring and thanks for sharing your stats.

17908,HgrFyitP4bo,"a couple suggestions that might be fun to see in game: ropes that you can swing on would be a welcome addition to diversify gameplay. i think a small fireball would be a cool rock skin to put in the game as well (you can recolor it 5 different times to milk it as much as possible). i'm very exited to see this games future, so good luck.",88.0,2.0
17909,HgrFyitP4bo,"you should add a ""taunt"" ability for the hiders that plays a monkey sound ( the seekers can hear it ) , the hiders can taunt manually but every 2 mins it automatically taunts , because it is still really easy to hide from the seekers",51.0,1.0

17917,ukzFI9rgwfU,"**Summary**:
- machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data
- there are lots of different ways (""algorithms"") that machines can learn 
- the algorithms can be grouped into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement algorithms*

- the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be input-output pairs or just inputs
- supervised learning algorithms require input-output pairs (i.e. they require the output)
- unsupervised learning requires only the input data (not the outputs)

- here is how, in general, supervised algorithms work:
- you feed it an example input, then the associated output
- you repeat the above step many many times
- eventually, the algorithm picks up a pattern between the inputs and outputs
- now, you can feed it a brand new input, and it will predict the output for you

- here is how, in general, unsupervised algorithms work:
- you feed it an example input (without the associated output)
- you repeat the above step many times
- eventually, the algorithm clusters your inputs into groups
- now, you can feed it a brand new input, and the algorithm will predict which cluster it belongs with

* the first example in this video used the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm

Hope that was useful to someone!

Thanks for the video, really enjoyed it!! :)",3432.0,1.0
17918,ukzFI9rgwfU,"Scenario 1: Facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs
Explanation: It is supervised learning. Here Facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person. Therefore, the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labeled data, it is supervised learning.


Scenario 2: Recommending new songs based on someone‚Äôs past music choices
Explanation: It is supervised learning. The model is training a classifier on pre-existing labels (genres of songs).
This is what Netflix, Pandora, and Spotify do all the time, they collect the songs/movies that you like already, evaluate the features based on your likes/dislikes and then recommend new movies/songs based on similar features.


Scenario 3: Analyze bank data for suspicious-looking transactions and flag the fraud transactions
Explanation: It is unsupervised learning. In this case, the suspicious transactions are not defined, hence there are no labels of ""fraud"" and ""not fraud"". The model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as 'fraud'.",1547.0,1.0

18036,yN7ypxC7838,"I always find it interesting that the statement ""logistic regression is a classification method"" is repeated so often, despite 'regression' being right there in the name.  Like decision trees (CART), random forest and other similar methods, there are both regression and classification versions of the method.  In a binary outcome problem, we model the process as flipping a coin that has a probability p of coming up heads (1) and 1-p of coming up tails (0).  We can either predict p, a continuous value between 0 and 1, or we can predict the outcome, itself, which is in {0,1}.  The former is regression; the latter is classification.  Logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff (sometimes, but not always, 0.5) to predict the outcome.  Many times, the probability is more important (for example, lots of the same type of customer -> you do not want to assume all of them are 1's, when p is estimated to be 0.6) and sometimes the outcome is more important (for example, making a decision to approve an application for credit.)",27.0,1.0

18088,reY50t2hbuM,"ML reminds me Big Data's hype few years ago, some senior software engineers were scared of being overtaken by junior if they did not learn it, so they wanted to ""train"" themselves puting an Hadoop stack in every single projects they were working on, until they eventually understood it was not the holy grail of data processing. It just allows to solve some problems (and not all) in a more efficient way than other methods.

I think people in tech industry should all learn what  ML is, what it can do, hardware requierments and what gains it can provide, so  they can know if they really need it. Then, maybe, they should learn it in depth, but first search if there is an existing product that meet their requierements.

I just wanted to point out that I believe your analysis of ""One Shot Learning"" re: human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base. The learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling, sitting up, and standing up. This process takes usually between 1 and 2 years. This time (and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it) is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible. The process can be accelerated through coordination-specific training on the part of the parents (which occurs quite often). Errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road (e.g. requiring knee replacement at 55) Bipedalism is pretty complex, and is way harder than quadrupedalism, which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim.",41.0,2.0

18234,t4K6lney7Zw,it's not always that you want an unlimited dataset in machine learning. Sometimes you want to limit your dataset. For example if you're trying to figure out if you're in a stock market recession or expansion you don't want to go over 2 years (+- months) of data because you'll end up in another cycle. Symmetry and Domain limits are important in machine learning. My point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources,0.0,0.0

4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set.

18300,6M5VXKLf4D4,"Hi everyone, exactly a week ago, we conducted a contest in this video. The answer to the question is given below:
The correct order of working for Neural Network with explanation: 
B. The weighted sum of inputs is calculated
A. The Bias is added
D. The result is fed to an activation function
C. Specific Neuron is activated

Explanation: In a neural network, each neuron in one layer is connected to other neurons in the corresponding layers. These connections carry random weights. The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated, and an additional input in the form of bias is added (w * x + b). The result of this is fed to an activation function. Based on a particular threshold value, only those neurons get activated that crosses the threshold value.

We are pleased to announce the 3 lucky winners who got the right answer for our quiz:

From my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic. 
However, if you want to reach an even wider audience, considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak English, I suggest:
1. To associate the subtitles, even if in English, as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery;
2. That the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way, as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language.

18359,AO6urf07KjE,"I would also like to point out that actually *understanding* machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics (as was mentioned as a benefit, being part of something), will be EXTREMELY difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability + statistics. In fact, at my university, in order to enrol in the first machine learning course, you need to have taken 4 semesters of calculus (with proofs, as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops), one or two courses in linear algebra, and 2 courses in statistics. 
That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs impossible to use ML without that, of course it isn‚Äôt. However, it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge (much more so than with required programming knowledge for ML). 
So yes, you will be ‚Äúa part of something‚Äù, in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with, but it‚Äôs a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ML publications at a meaningful level, or be generating their own custom models",12.0,1.0

18363,AO6urf07KjE,"I'm taking a few online ML tutorials and have a text book (not related to the course) and I have to say that it is very similar to what I did in econometric with regards to predicting. The regression analysis in ML is the same as I did in econometric but I just I didn't use python to do it, I was using Stata, but you could use R to do the same thing and now days I'm sure they are teaching python in economics. At any rate, even after taking econometrics and taking a ML course I still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful. Albeit I do recognize that ML is a large topic and the first part of learning ML that I am doing (including the textbook) all start off doing Regression Analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesn't use when they talk about ML and the other parts I have yet to get to like AI and Neural Networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about? IDK.

I often hear people say that ML is used for large datasets like at Netflix, Google, Amazon or etc to help suggest something (or something along those lines). Well, that's all fine and good, but I don't work at a company like Netflix or Google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill. The other problem is that to use ML at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ML course that it is very complicated and won't go into. Thus, kind of making the example of these FANG companies almost useless in the short term, and medium term. When you learn about ML you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chart/graph with a line through it e.g. the trend line. Technically, you could use EXCEL to reproduce some of the things I have learned in ML, so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating.  Or, other things in ML like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age, salary, and whether or not they bought a car. You can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes $70k will they buy a car? It will be based off a percentage, of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not.  The problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes. And real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc. So, it becomes hard to do your own projects in ML because they don't really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects.     

Most of the time the ML tutorials focuses on how to do the predication/trend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using. They just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset. This is a huge issue if you want to try doing ML on your own data because they don't teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a small-medium business or say your website has x amount of traffic, etc.  

I'm often left wondering how the ML regression Analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter. For example, in my book they talk about using ML to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression. Or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 5-7 factors. But to be honest the housing sample is a great example, but I often have trouble trying to think of a problem that I could create using ML to predict a result (ie my own project). Also, the examples often are intuitive, like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be I don't even need data or run ML on it to know that. It can get de-motiving at times. So, the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true. Like predicting gas prices will be higher in the Summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacation/travel during summer. Also, they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter. It's 200+ pages like that. Countless hours of videos from tutorials saying, ""Now, of course the real life data will not look anything like this, but you get the idea""...    I am kind of stuck in-between smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ML and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what I want. I'm tempted to skip 20 hours or 200+ pages ahead and dive into the Neural Networks but can't stop thinking that maybe Regression Analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way  will be helpful in the AI section, or whatever. 

So far, it's like learning basic Statistics but in Python.",9.0,1.0

18365,AO6urf07KjE,"at first I thought i will learn machine learning in 6 months, with some coding experience. i dedicated 5 hours on normal day and 10 hours a day on weekends to study the field and make it in 6 months.
and guess what, in reality it took me 1+ year of hard working and studying this field to be able to build deploy deep learning models and to only begin comprehending state of the art models and begin to mix different algorithms to solve a specific problem.
time may vary from person to other but real hard work and dedication is required.
if i was to go back and change the way i learned things rather than just jumping to the field :
first to learn data structures and algorithms, programming logic.
then try to learn and apply some basic algorithms like binary search, reverse linked list, string manipulation..., this will help you so much to improve coding skills.
the first step will help you so much in processing data solving problems related to data and getting your models to work using your own way.
second learn some basic calculus and statistics, linear algebra, probability, dot product,  gradient descent...
third learn machine learning algorithms and try to apply them using your programming skills.",6.0,1.0

There are a lot of interesting problems to solve along the way that I probably wouldn't even realize existed if I stayed in academia for a PhD.
